Detailed Description,"Huvishka(I)'s son Kanishka (Kanishka I), who was so far being 
considered the successor of Wima  Kadphises, had issued coins in 
gold and copper; and on the coins of gold and silver. He used the 
same type of his portrayal- standing, dressed in a long tunic, 
shalwar, mantle held by double clasp at the chest and a low round 
cap, sacrifice at an alter and holding a spear in his left hand, 
but at the same time he did not confirm the reverse of his coins 
to any one particular deity. Deity bearing Iranian name Mao has 
been depicted on the reverse of this coin. He ended the bilingual 
tradition of Greek and Kharoshthi and retained only Greeck for a 
while and issued coins with the legend Basileos Basilion 
Kanishkou."
