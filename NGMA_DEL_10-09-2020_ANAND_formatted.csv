A Sketch of Coconut Tree and Clouds,ngma-04227,"National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi",Painting,,Watercolor on Paper,,Ramkinkar Baij,,Indian,,"Ramkinkar Baij, one of the most seminal artists of modern India, was an iconic sculptor, painter and graphic artist. Ramkinkar Baij (1906-1980) was born in Bankura, West Bengal, into a family of little economic and social standing and grew by his sheer determination into one of the most distinguished early modernists of Indian art. In 1925, he made his way to Kala Bhavana, the art school at Santiniketan and was under the guidance of Nandalal Bose. Encouraged by the liberating, intellectual environment of Santiniketan, his artistic skills and intellectual horizons blossomed, thus acquiring greater depth and complexity. Soon after completing his studies at Kala Bhavana he became a faculty member, and along with Nandalal Bose and Benodebehari Mukherjee played a pivotal role in making Santiniketan one of the most important centres for modern art in pre-Independent India. In 1970, the Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan for his irrefutable contribution to Indian art. Ramkinkar's monumental sculptures are established landmarks in public art. One of the earliest modernists in Indian art, he assimilated the idioms of the European modern visual language and yet was rooted in his own Indian ethos. He experimented restlessly with forms, moving freely from figurative to abstract and back to figurative, his themes were steeped in a deep sense of humanism and an instinctive understanding of the symbiotic relationship between man and nature. Both in his paintings and sculptures, he pushed the limits of experimentation and ventured into the use of new materials. For instance, his use of unconventional material, for the time, such as cement concrete for his monumental public sculptures set a new precedent for art practices. The use of cement, laterite and mortar to model the figures, and the use of a personal style in which modern western and Indian pre-classical sculptural values were brought together was equally radical.",,India,,Signed 'Ramkinkar' and dated '12.3' in Bengali in the bottom-right corner of the painting.,,28.7 x 19 cm,,"Ramkinkar Baij selected images for his sculptors and paintings from his
rural surroundings. The poor and the downtrodden figured primarily as his
subjects. Baij's watercolours mostly reflects his preoccupation with nature and the
animal world. His work is characterized by tremendous energy, dynamism and the use of
earthy colours. In the above painting, the artist has depicted a landscape with dabs and dashes of watercolour
in tonal variation delineating the form.",,"Ramkinkar Baij was a reclusive modernist artist who always remained on the fringes of the art market. He took a great interest in human figures, body language and in the general human drama. Modern Western art and pre and post-classical Indian art were his main point of reference. Although primarily known for his expressionistic sculpture, he was also a gifted painter. The sense of rhythm that his sculpture was noted for, is manifested brilliantly in his watercolours.

Soon after completing his studies at Kala Bhavana he became a faculty member, and along with Nandalal Bose and Benodebehari Mukherjee played a pivotal role in making Santiniketan one of the most important centres for modern art in pre-Independent India. In 1970, the Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan for his irrefutable contribution to Indian art. Ramkinkar's monumental sculptures are established landmarks in public art. One of the earliest modernists in Indian art, he assimilated the idioms of the European modern visual language and yet was rooted in his own Indian ethos.

Both in his paintings and sculptures, he pushed the limits of experimentation and ventured into the use of new materials. For instance, his use of unconventional material, for the time, such as cement concrete for his monumental public sculptures set a new precedent for art practices.

Ramkinkar Baij (1906-1980) was born in Bankura, West Bengal, into a family of little economic and social standing and grew by his sheer determination into one of the most distinguished early modernists of Indian art. In 1925, he made his way to Kala Bhavana, the art school at Santiniketan and was under the guidance of Nandalal Bose. Encouraged by the liberating, intellectual environment of Santiniketan, his artistic skills and intellectual horizons blossomed, thus acquiring greater depth and complexity. Soon after completing his studies at Kala Bhavana he became a faculty member, and along with Nandalal Bose and Benodebehari Mukherjee played a pivotal role in making Santiniketan one of the most important centres for modern art in pre-Independent India. In 1970, the Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan for his irrefutable contribution to Indian art. Ramkinkar's monumental sculptures are established landmarks in public art. One of the earliest modernists in Indian art, he assimilated the idioms of the European modern visual language and yet was rooted in his own Indian ethos. He experimented restlessly with forms, moving freely from figurative to abstract and back to figurative, his themes were steeped in a deep sense of humanism and an instinctive understanding of the symbiotic relationship between man and nature. Both in his paintings and sculptures, he pushed the limits of experimentation and ventured into the use of new materials. For instance, his use of unconventional material, for the time, such as cement concrete for his monumental public sculptures set a new precedent for art practices. The use of cement, laterite and mortar to model the figures, and the use of a personal style in which modern western and Indian pre-classical sculptural values were brought together was equally radical.",,India,,Signed 'Ramkinkar Baij' and dated '1971' in English along the lower margin of the painting.,,32.2 x 27.7 cm,,"Ramkinkar was well aware of the post-industrial art or modern art movements in the western and eastern art worlds and tried to incorporate the dynamics of such changes in his own work while keeping the aesthetic tradition of Santiniketan in focus.

"Trees, 1946",ngma-04503,"National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi",Painting,,,,Abanindranath Tagore (1871 - 1951),,Indian,,"Abanindranath was born in the creatively distinguished family of Tagores of Jorasanko in Kolkata. In his youth, Abanindranath received training in European and Academic style from European artists, Olinto Gilhardi and C.E.Palmer. But sometime during the last decade of the 19th century, he developed distaste for the corporeality of European naturalism. Coincidentally, about the same time he received an album of Mughal miniatures and a book of English poems illuminated in the Art Nouveau style. These influenced Abanindranath's visual ideas deeply. A third source of inspiration came from the visit of the Japanese philosopher and aesthetician Okakura Kakuzo to Kolkata in 1902. Okakura's visit led to the coming of the Japanese artists Taikan and Hishida in 1903. The two Japanese artists taught Abanindranath the wash technique which appealed to the artists' romanticism.
These various triggers led Abanindranath to evolve a distinctive visual language that was delicate, sensitive, dreamy and rich in atmosphere he synthesized in his paintings the Western and Eastern aesthetics. Although, Abanindranath painted a range of subjects, he had a leaning towards painting images with historic or literary allusions. He liked to paint sets of images dealing with a theme or a text such as the 'Arabian Nights' or the 'Krishna Leela'. He also enjoyed painting theatrical subjects. Literature and drama held great respect for him and he was an elegant and accomplished writer. Towards his sunset years, he started making whimsical sculptures with found material like driftwood. The NGMA has a few of his these works.",,India,,"Signed 'Abanindra' in Bengali vertically at bottom right corner of

N. S. Bendre also worked in the company of Nandalal Bose, Ram Kinkar Baij and Benod Behari Mukherjee during his stay in Santiniketan as an Artist in Residence in the year 1945. An ardent traveller, Bendre made a journey in 1947-48 to USA, Europe and other foreign countries getting acquainted with the works of modern masters of the West. The artist then experimented with cubism and expressionism assimilating them with traditional Indian classical and folk art styles. In his later years, in the 1960s, Bendre adopted the Neo- impressionistic technique of pointillism in his works eliminating the details and paying more attention to creating an overall sensory experience in his compositions. N S Bendre joined the Progressive Artists Group, Bombay in 1948. He started teaching at the Faculty of Fine Arts, Baroda in 1950 and later became the Dean of the Faculty of Painting in 1959.

He painted scenes of war on the documentation including Bengal famine and Tebhaga Movement which were based on the agitation between the landlords and the tenants in 1948.During this uprising , Hore came in contact of Chittaprosad Bhattacharya , who himself was a print maker and a strategist. Later his joining at the Government College of Art and Craft , Calcutta in 1954 made him learn the printmaking techniques of lithography and intaglio . At then, Haren Das was the acting head of the graphics department which gave Hore the advantage of learning from him. Hore came up with an invention of the paper pulp printing along with various amalgamations of different media which gave him utter recognition. His series of abstract paper pulp 'Wounds' fetch him a number of accolades and appreciation. Later he moved to Santiniketan, worked for Kala Bhawan . His association with K.G. Subramanyam and Ramkinkar Baij at the Viswa Bharati University results in his inclination towards the sculptures. He contorted the sculptures in bronze. He also headed the Graphics Department of College of Art, Delhi along with the visiting experience as a faculty in M.S.U. Baroda.",,India,,,,8.5 x 9.5 cm,,"Somnath Hore's works are filled by humanist eye, inclination towards empathy, and his communist ideology. Tension in lines and emaciating figures were significant in most of his works. He was driven with the feeling of anguished and suffering of the poor. The overall impression one gets from his works is the depth of poverty he has starved in. In this print, he has rendered a boy sitting and posing in front of the still life with fine, firm yet fluid strokes incised on to a metal sheet and transferred on the plain surface with the help of ink, articulating the contours of the figures.",,"Somnath Hore is remembered because of his creativity and excellence in inventing new media of printing techniques. Though Gaganendranath Tagore was the father of Indian printmaking, Hore made his presence felt immensely in it. The depiction of the sufferings and atrocities of the poor and the anguished figures with a placement of soaring birds and animals occupy most of the art works produced. His experiments with various print-making techniques and mediums such as etching, intaglio and lithographs led him to develop a new medium called 'Pulp-prints'.",,,,NGMA-New Delhi,,Etching Print,,Etching Print,,

His freedom of spirit let him move beyond their confines enabling him to conjure up the powerfully evocative and communicative images we see in his work today. He didn't want to paint only the comprehensible, but instead wanted to discover and explore the world that lies beyond the realms of logic. The idea of duality in the iconography finds a place in all of his recent works. It pervades every aspect of the pieces, operating between what we see and what is hidden, what stands out blatantly and what evades our attention, as well as between the different levels of consciousness. Almost as if it is testing us and playing tricks on our senses. But even though an apparent structural divide exists in his paintings, they do not lack any dynamic energy.

A disciple of Abanindranath Tagore, he graduated from Government School of Art, Calcutta in 1910. Nandalal was fascinated by the potential of folk art and indigenous modes of expression and inculcated them in his works although stylising them in a unique representation for depiction and narration of local life. His explorative temperament with artistic materials allowed him to create a vast body of work with printmaking techniques such as lithography, linoleum prints and Sino-Japanese techniques while remaining faithful to his narrative subject: India's environment and its ethos. Nandalal Bose's art conjures newness unbound, yet it is flushed with the memories of yesterday. Inspired by Far Eastern sensibilities that celebrate the traditional, the genius of his art lies in the interplay of sensual silhouettes and his powerful rendering of contemporary themes with the traditions, customs and sensibilities of Indian heritage. It is this intermingling that invigorates his works and captures the minds of his viewers. He began his artistic career in the fervour of the Swadeshi movement, rejecting western colonial norms of art and taking inspiration from the ancient murals of Ajanta and Bagh caves as well as Mughal miniatures. In 1919, Nandalal Bose accepted Rabindranath Tagore's invitation to become the Principal of the newly established art school Kala Bhavan at Visvabharati University in Santiniketan. He travelled in and out of India including places like Burma, China, Japan, Malaysia, Java and Sri Lanka seeking artistic stimulus from observing different cultural traditions. He also painted a series of posters for the Indian National Congress at Haripura in February 1938. The range of Nandalal's artistic expression is seen in his various landscapes with human figures, his varied images of nature and the Santiniketan Murals.

Through twirls, swirls, dabs and dashes, he ventured to depict rhythm in the elements of nature and the relationship between nature and himself.

Bhutia,ngma-04832,"National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi",Painting,,Watercolour on paper,,Nandalal Bose,,Indian,,"Nandalal Bose, popularly known as the Master Moshai, was born on December 3rd, 1882 in Kharagpur, Monghyr District, Bihar. A disciple of Abanindranath Tagore, he graduated from Government School of Art, Calcutta in 1910. Nandalal was fascinated by the potential of folk art and indigenous modes of expression and inculcated them in his works although stylising them in a unique representation for depiction and narration of local life. His explorative temperament with artistic materials allowed him to create a vast body of work with printmaking techniques such as lithography, linoleum prints and Sino-Japanese techniques while remaining faithful to his narrative subject: India's environment and its ethos. Nandalal Bose's art conjures newness unbound, yet it is flushed with the memories of yesterday. Inspired by Far Eastern sensibilities that celebrate the traditional, the genius of his art lies in the interplay of sensual silhouettes and his powerful rendering of contemporary themes with the traditions, customs and sensibilities of Indian heritage. It is this intermingling that invigorates his works and captures the minds of his viewers. He began his artistic career in the fervour of the Swadeshi movement, rejecting western colonial norms of art and taking inspiration from the ancient murals of Ajanta and Bagh caves as well as Mughal miniatures. In 1919, Nandalal Bose accepted Rabindranath Tagore's invitation to become the Principal of the newly established art school Kala Bhavan at Visvabharati University in Santiniketan. He travelled in and out of India including places like Burma, China, Japan, Malaysia, Java and Sri Lanka seeking artistic stimulus from observing different cultural traditions. He also painted a series of posters for the Indian National Congress at Haripura in February 1938. The range of Nandalal's artistic expression is seen in his various landscapes with human figures, his varied images of nature and the Santiniketan Murals. His works reflect the changing landscape, portraying people and places at a time when modern India's cultural development was at its threshold. Nandalal Bose died on April 16th, 1966 in Santiniketan, West Bengal. He won several accolades including the Padma Vibhushan by the President of India in 1953.
