Artist's Nationality,Indian
Artist's Life Date / Bio Data,"Ramkinkar Baij, one of the most seminal artists of modern India, was an iconic sculptor, painter and graphic artist. Ramkinkar Baij (1906-1980) was born in Bankura, West Bengal, into a family of little economic and social standing and grew by his sheer determination into one of the most distinguished early modernists of Indian art. In 1925, he made his way to Kala Bhavana, the art school at Santiniketan and was under the guidance of Nandalal Bose. Encouraged by the liberating, intellectual environment of Santiniketan, his artistic skills and intellectual horizons blossomed, thus acquiring greater depth and complexity. Soon after completing his studies at Kala Bhavana he became a faculty member, and along with Nandalal Bose and Benodebehari Mukherjee played a pivotal role in making Santiniketan one of the most important centres for modern art in pre-Independent India. In 1970, the Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan for his irrefutable contribution to Indian art. Ramkinkar's monumental sculptures are established landmarks in public art. One of the earliest modernists in Indian art, he assimilated the idioms of the European modern visual language and yet was rooted in his own Indian ethos. He experimented restlessly with forms, moving freely from figurative to abstract and back to figurative, his themes were steeped in a deep sense of humanism and an instinctive understanding of the symbiotic relationship between man and nature. Both in his paintings and sculptures, he pushed the limits of experimentation and ventured into the use of new materials. For instance, his use of unconventional material, for the time, such as cement concrete for his monumental public sculptures set a new precedent for art practices. The use of cement, laterite and mortar to model the figures, and the use of a personal style in which modern western and Indian pre-classical sculptural values were brought together was equally radical."

Inscription,Signed 'Ramkinkar' and dated '12.3' in Bengali in the bottom-right corner of the painting.
Dimensions,28.7 x 19 cm
Brief Description,"Ramkinkar Baij selected images for his sculptors and paintings from his
rural surroundings. The poor and the downtrodden figured primarily as his
subjects. Baij's watercolours mostly reflects his preoccupation with nature and the
animal world. His work is characterized by tremendous energy, dynamism and the use of
earthy colours. In the above painting, the artist has depicted a landscape with dabs and dashes of watercolour
in tonal variation delineating the form."
Detailed Description,"Ramkinkar Baij was a reclusive modernist artist who always remained on the fringes of the art market. He took a great interest in human figures, body language and in the general human drama. Modern Western art and pre and post-classical Indian art were his main point of reference. Although primarily known for his expressionistic sculpture, he was also a gifted painter. The sense of rhythm that his sculpture was noted for, is manifested brilliantly in his watercolours. His works in the Kalighat tradition interconnected with Cubism to achieve an unusual personal idiom. Both his sculpture and his paintings are unprompted and bold."

In 1925, he made his way to Kala Bhavana, the art school at Santiniketan and was under the guidance of Nandalal Bose. Encouraged by the liberating, intellectual environment of Santiniketan, his artistic skills and intellectual horizons blossomed, thus acquiring greater depth and complexity. Soon after completing his studies at Kala Bhavana he became a faculty member, and along with Nandalal Bose and Benodebehari Mukherjee played a pivotal role in making Santiniketan one of the most important centres for modern art in pre-Independent India. In 1970, the Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan for his irrefutable contribution to Indian art. Ramkinkar's monumental sculptures are established landmarks in public art. One of the earliest modernists in Indian art, he assimilated the idioms of the European modern visual language and yet was rooted in his own Indian ethos. He experimented restlessly with forms, moving freely from figurative to abstract and back to figurative, his themes were steeped in a deep sense of humanism and an instinctive understanding of the symbiotic relationship between man and nature. Both in his paintings and sculptures, he pushed the limits of experimentation and ventured into the use of new materials. For instance, his use of unconventional material, for the time, such as cement concrete for his monumental public sculptures set a new precedent for art practices. The use of cement, laterite and mortar to model the figures, and the use of a personal style in which modern western and Indian pre-classical sculptural values were brought together was equally radical."

Brief Description,"Ramkinkar Baij was a reclusive modernist artist who always remained on the fringes of the art market. He took a great interest in human figures, body language and in the general human drama. Modern Western art and pre and post-classical Indian art were his main points of reference. Although primarily known for his expressionistic sculpture, he was also a gifted painter. The sense of rhythm that his sculpture was noted for is manifested brilliantly in his paintings and sketches. His works in the Kalighat tradition interconnected with Cubism to achieve an unusual personal idiom. Both his sculpture and his paintings are unprompted and bold."

Although primarily known for his expressionistic sculpture, he was also a gifted painter. The sense of rhythm that his sculpture was noted for is manifested brilliantly in his paintings and sketches. His works in the Kalighat tradition interconnected with Cubism to achieve an unusual personal idiom. Both his sculpture and his paintings are unprompted and bold."

Artist's Life Date / Bio Data,"Ramkinkar Baij, one of the most seminal artists of modern India, was an iconic sculptor, painter and graphic artist. Ramkinkar Baij (1906-1980) was born in Bankura, West Bengal, into a family of little economic and social standing and grew by his sheer determination into one of the most distinguished early modernists of Indian art. In 1925, he made his way to Kala Bhavana, the art school at Santiniketan and was under the guidance of Nandalal Bose. Encouraged by the liberating, intellectual environment of Santiniketan, his artistic skills and intellectual horizons blossomed, thus acquiring greater depth and complexity. Soon after completing his studies at Kala Bhavana he became a faculty member, and along with Nandalal Bose and Benodebehari Mukherjee played a pivotal role in making Santiniketan one of the most important centres for modern art in pre-Independent India. In 1970, the Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan for his irrefutable contribution to Indian art. Ramkinkar's monumental sculptures are established landmarks in public art. One of the earliest modernists in Indian art, he assimilated the idioms of the European modern visual language and yet was rooted in his own Indian ethos. He experimented restlessly with forms, moving freely from figurative to abstract and back to figurative, his themes were steeped in a deep sense of humanism and an instinctive understanding of the symbiotic relationship between man and nature. Both in his paintings and sculptures, he pushed the limits of experimentation and ventured into the use of new materials. For instance, his use of unconventional material, for the time, such as cement concrete for his monumental public sculptures set a new precedent for art practices. The use of cement, laterite and mortar to model the figures, and the use of a personal style in which modern western and Indian pre-classical sculptural values were brought together was equally radical."

For instance, his use of unconventional material, for the time, such as cement concrete for his monumental public sculptures set a new precedent for art practices. The use of cement, laterite and mortar to model the figures, and the use of a personal style in which modern western and Indian pre-classical sculptural values were brought together was equally radical."

Brief Description,"Ramkinkar
Baij’s artistic temperament was defined at Santiniketan, an art institution
known for providing an informed western modernistic environment to the
students. Baij was immensely influenced by his austere surroundings, the
ordinary people and nature that became the subject matter for painting and
sculpture. In this sketch, he has depicted a nude female figure standing near the
table, rendered with fluid, swift strokes of ink in tonal variation. The
treatment is intended to exemplify an energetic and lively artistic
temperament."
Detailed Description,"Ramkinkar Baij was a reclusive modernist artist who always remained on the fringes of the art market. He took a great interest in human figures, body language and in the general human drama. Modern Western art and pre and post-classical Indian art were his main point of reference. Although primarily known for his expressionistic sculpture, he was also a gifted painter. The sense of rhythm that his sculpture was noted for is manifested brilliantly in his paintings and sketches. His works in the Kalighat tradition interconnected with Cubism to achieve an unusual personal idiom. Both his sculpture and his paintings are unprompted and bold."

For instance, his use of unconventional material, for the time, such as cement concrete for his monumental public sculptures set a new precedent for art practices.

Brief Description,"Ramkinkar Baij was a reclusive modernist artist who always remained on the fringes of the art market. He took a great interest in human figures, body language and in the general human drama. Modern Western art and pre and post-classical Indian art were his main points of reference. Although primarily known for his expressionistic sculpture, he was also a gifted painter. The sense of rhythm that his sculpture was noted for is manifested brilliantly in his paintings and sketches. His works in the Kalighat tradition interconnected with Cubism to achieve an unusual personal idiom. Both his sculpture and his paintings are unprompted and bold."

Ramkinkar Baij (1906-1980) was born in Bankura, West Bengal, into a family of little economic and social standing and grew by his sheer determination into one of the most distinguished early modernists of Indian art. In 1925, he made his way to Kala Bhavana, the art school at Santiniketan and was under the guidance of Nandalal Bose. Encouraged by the liberating, intellectual environment of Santiniketan, his artistic skills and intellectual horizons blossomed, thus acquiring greater depth and complexity. Soon after completing his studies at Kala Bhavana he became a faculty member, and along with Nandalal Bose and Benodebehari Mukherjee played a pivotal role in making Santiniketan one of the most important centres for modern art in pre-Independent India. In 1970, the Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan for his irrefutable contribution to Indian art. Ramkinkar's monumental sculptures are established landmarks in public art. One of the earliest modernists in Indian art, he assimilated the idioms of the European modern visual language and yet was rooted in his own Indian ethos. He experimented restlessly with forms, moving freely from figurative to abstract and back to figurative, his themes were steeped in a deep sense of humanism and an instinctive understanding of the symbiotic relationship between man and nature. Both in his paintings and sculptures, he pushed the limits of experimentation and ventured into the use of new materials. For instance, his use of unconventional material, for the time, such as cement concrete for his monumental public sculptures set a new precedent for art practices. The use of cement, laterite and mortar to model the figures, and the use of a personal style in which modern western and Indian pre-classical sculptural values were brought together was equally radical."

the nature that it became its subject matter for painting and sculpture.
Ramkinkar Baij was immensely influenced by his austere surrounding, the
ordinary people and the nature that became his subject matter for painting and
sculpture.  In this panting, he has rendered a self-portrait with dabs and
dashes of watercolour merging together in tonal variation and defining the
contours of a face."
Detailed Description,"Ramkinkar Baij was a reclusive modernist artist who always remained on the fringes of the art market. He took a great interest in human figures, body language and in the general human drama. Modern Western art and pre and post-classical Indian art were his main point of reference. Although primarily known for his expressionistic sculpture, he was also a gifted painter. The sense of rhythm that his sculpture was noted for is manifested brilliantly in his paintings and sketches. His works in the Kalighat tradition interconnected with Cubism to achieve an unusual personal idiom. Both his sculpture and his paintings are unprompted and bold."

primarily as his subjects. Baij's
watercolours mostly reflects his preoccupation with nature and the animal
world. His work is characterized by tremendous
energy, dynamism and the use of earthy colours.
In the above painting, the artist has depicted a group of villagers with dabs and
dashes of watercolour in tonal variation delineating the form."
Detailed Description,"Ramkinkar Baij was a reclusive modernist artist who always remained on the fringes of the art market. He took a great interest in human figures, body language and in the general human drama. Modern Western art and pre and post-classical Indian art were his main point of reference. Although primarily known for his expressionistic sculpture, he was also a gifted painter. The sense of rhythm that his sculpture was noted for, is manifested brilliantly in his watercolours. His works in the Kalighat tradition interconnected with Cubism to achieve an unusual personal idiom. Both his sculpture and his paintings are unprompted and bold."

Artist's Life Date / Bio Data,"Ramkinkar Baij, one of the most seminal artists of modern India, was an iconic sculptor, painter and graphic artist. Ramkinkar Baij (1906-1980) was born in Bankura, West Bengal, into a family of little economic and social standing and grew by his sheer determination into one of the most distinguished early modernists of Indian art. In 1925, he made his way to Kala Bhavana, the art school at Santiniketan and was under the guidance of Nandalal Bose. Encouraged by the liberating, intellectual environment of Santiniketan, his artistic skills and intellectual horizons blossomed, thus acquiring greater depth and complexity. Soon after completing his studies at Kala Bhavana he became a faculty member, and along with Nandalal Bose and Benodebehari Mukherjee played a pivotal role in making Santiniketan one of the most important centres for modern art in pre-Independent India. In 1970, the Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan for his irrefutable contribution to Indian art. Ramkinkar's monumental sculptures are established landmarks in public art. One of the earliest modernists in Indian art, he assimilated the idioms of the European modern visual language and yet was rooted in his own Indian ethos. He experimented restlessly with forms, moving freely from figurative to abstract and back to figurative, his themes were steeped in a deep sense of humanism and an instinctive understanding of the symbiotic relationship between man and nature. Both in his paintings and sculptures, he pushed the limits of experimentation and ventured into the use of new materials. For instance, his use of unconventional material, for the time, such as cement concrete for his monumental public sculptures set a new precedent for art practices. The use of cement, laterite and mortar to model the figures, and the use of a personal style in which modern western and Indian pre-classical sculptural values were brought together was equally radical."

Brief Description,"Ramkinkar deep felt love and oneness with nature could be
seen in his vigorously painted and sculpted images of the animals, birds, flora
and fauna in his surroundings. In this painting, he has depicted a landscape, rendered
with dabs and dashes of watercolour merging together in tonal variation and
fluid strokes of ink delineating the forms and adding grace to the composition."

He experimented restlessly with forms, moving freely from figurative to abstract and back to figurative, his themes were steeped in a deep sense of humanism and an instinctive understanding of the symbiotic relationship between man and nature. Both in his paintings and sculptures, he pushed the limits of experimentation and ventured into the use of new materials. For instance, his use of unconventional material, for the time, such as cement concrete for his monumental public sculptures set a new precedent for art practices. The use of cement, laterite and mortar to model the figures, and the use of a personal style in which modern western and Indian pre-classical sculptural values were brought together was equally radical."

Brief Description,"Ramkinkar Baij selected
images for his sculptures and paintings from his rural surroundings. The poor
and the downtrodden figured primarily as his subjects. Baij's
watercolours mostly reflect his preoccupation with nature and the animal world.
His work is
characterized by tremendous energy, dynamism and the use of earthy colours. In the above painting, the artist has depicted
a landscape with dabs and dashes of watercolour in tonal
variation delineating the form."
Detailed Description,"Ramkinkar Baij was a reclusive modernist artist who always remained on the fringes of the art market. He took a great interest in human figures, body language and in the general human drama. Modern Western art and pre and post-classical Indian art were his main point of reference. Although primarily known for his expressionistic sculpture, he was also a gifted painter. The sense of rhythm that his sculpture was noted for, is manifested brilliantly in his watercolours. His works in the Kalighat tradition interconnected with Cubism to achieve an unusual personal idiom. Both his sculpture and his paintings are unprompted and bold."

Artist's Life Date / Bio Data,"Ramkinkar Baij, one of the most seminal artists of modern India, was an iconic sculptor, painter and graphic artist. Ramkinkar Baij (1906-1980) was born in Bankura, West Bengal, into a family of little economic and social standing and grew by his sheer determination into one of the most distinguished early modernists of Indian art. In 1925, he made his way to Kala Bhavana, the art school at Santiniketan and was under the guidance of Nandalal Bose. Encouraged by the liberating, intellectual environment of Santiniketan, his artistic skills and intellectual horizons blossomed, thus acquiring greater depth and complexity. Soon after completing his studies at Kala Bhavana he became a faculty member, and along with Nandalal Bose and Benodebehari Mukherjee played a pivotal role in making Santiniketan one of the most important centres for modern art in pre-Independent India.

influenced by his austere surroundings, the ordinary people and nature that
became the subject matter for painting and sculpture. In this sketch, he has
depicted a skeleton form of a mother and child, rendered with the use of fluid,
bold strokes of ink suggesting the basic form of the figures."

In 1925, he made his way to Kala Bhavana, the art school at Santiniketan and was under the guidance of Nandalal Bose. Encouraged by the liberating, intellectual environment of Santiniketan, his artistic skills and intellectual horizons blossomed, thus acquiring greater depth and complexity. Soon after completing his studies at Kala Bhavana he became a faculty member, and along with Nandalal Bose and Benodebehari Mukherjee played a pivotal role in making Santiniketan one of the most important centres for modern art in pre-Independent India. In 1970, the Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan for his irrefutable contribution to Indian art. Ramkinkar's monumental sculptures are established landmarks in public art. One of the earliest modernists in Indian art, he assimilated the idioms of the European modern visual language and yet was rooted in his own Indian ethos. He experimented restlessly with forms, moving freely from figurative to abstract and back to figurative, his themes were steeped in a deep sense of humanism and an instinctive understanding of the symbiotic relationship between man and nature. Both in his paintings and sculptures, he pushed the limits of experimentation and ventured into the use of new materials. For instance, his use of unconventional material, for the time, such as cement concrete for his monumental public sculptures set a new precedent for art practices. The use of cement, laterite and mortar to model the figures, and the use of a personal style in which modern western and Indian pre-classical sculptural values were brought together was equally radical."

Brief Description,"Ramkinkar Baij selected images for his sculptors and paintings from his
rural surroundings. The poor and the downtrodden figured primarily as his
subjects. His work is characterized by tremendous energy, dynamism
and the use of earthy colours. In
this sketch, the artist has depicted a woman in a sitting position, rendered with fluid, bold ink strokes delineating the form."
Detailed Description,"Ramkinkar Baij was a reclusive modernist artist who always remained on the fringes of the art market. He took a great interest in human figures, body language and in the general human drama. Modern Western art and pre and post-classical Indian art were his main point of reference. Although primarily known for his expressionistic sculpture, he was also a gifted painter. The sense of rhythm that his sculpture was noted for, is manifested brilliantly in his watercolours. His works in the Kalighat tradition interconnected with Cubism to achieve an unusual personal idiom. Both his sculpture and his paintings are unprompted and bold."

temperament was defined at Santiniketan, an art institution known for providing
an informed western modernistic environment to the students. Baij was immensely
influenced by his austere surroundings, the ordinary people and nature that
became the subject matter for painting and sculpture. In this sketch, he has depicted
a boy sitting under a tree and writing with a pen, rendered with fluid, fine
strokes of pencil delineating the form."
Detailed Description,"Ramkinkar Baij was a reclusive modernist artist who always remained on the fringes of the art market. He took a great interest in human figures, body language and in the general human drama. Modern Western art and pre and post-classical Indian art were his main point of reference. Although primarily known for his expressionistic sculpture, he was also a gifted painter. The sense of rhythm that his sculpture was noted for is manifested brilliantly in his paintings and sketches. His works in the Kalighat tradition interconnected with Cubism to achieve an unusual personal idiom. Both his sculpture and his paintings are unprompted and bold."

Artist's Life Date / Bio Data,"Ramkinkar Baij, one of the most seminal artists of modern India, was an iconic sculptor, painter and graphic artist. Ramkinkar Baij (1906-1980) was born in Bankura, West Bengal, into a family of little economic and social standing and grew by his sheer determination into one of the most distinguished early modernists of Indian art. In 1925, he made his way to Kala Bhavana, the art school at Santiniketan and was under the guidance of Nandalal Bose. Encouraged by the liberating, intellectual environment of Santiniketan, his artistic skills and intellectual horizons blossomed, thus acquiring greater depth and complexity. Soon after completing his studies at Kala Bhavana he became a faculty member, and along with Nandalal Bose and Benodebehari Mukherjee played a pivotal role in making Santiniketan one of the most important centres for modern art in pre-Independent India. In 1970, the Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan for his irrefutable contribution to Indian art. Ramkinkar's monumental sculptures are established landmarks in public art. One of the earliest modernists in Indian art, he assimilated the idioms of the European modern visual language and yet was rooted in his own Indian ethos. He experimented restlessly with forms, moving freely from figurative to abstract and back to figurative, his themes were steeped in a deep sense of humanism and an instinctive understanding of the symbiotic relationship between man and nature. Both in his paintings and sculptures, he pushed the limits of experimentation and ventured into the use of new materials. For instance, his use of unconventional material, for the time, such as cement concrete for his monumental public sculptures set a new precedent for art practices. The use of cement, laterite and mortar to model the figures, and the use of a personal style in which modern western and Indian pre-classical sculptural values were brought together was equally radical."

Artist's Life Date / Bio Data,"Ramkinkar Baij, one of the most seminal artists of modern India, was an iconic sculptor, painter and graphic artist. Ramkinkar Baij (1906-1980) was born in Bankura, West Bengal, into a family of little economic and social standing and grew by his sheer determination into one of the most distinguished early modernists of Indian art. In 1925, he made his way to Kala Bhavana, the art school at Santiniketan and was under the guidance of Nandalal Bose. Encouraged by the liberating, intellectual environment of Santiniketan, his artistic skills and intellectual horizons blossomed, thus acquiring greater depth and complexity. Soon after completing his studies at Kala Bhavana he became a faculty member, and along with Nandalal Bose and Benodebehari Mukherjee played a pivotal role in making Santiniketan one of the most important centres for modern art in pre-Independent India. In 1970, the Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan for his irrefutable contribution to Indian art. Ramkinkar's monumental sculptures are established landmarks in public art. One of the earliest modernists in Indian art, he assimilated the idioms of the European modern visual language and yet was rooted in his own Indian ethos. He experimented restlessly with forms, moving freely from figurative to abstract and back to figurative, his themes were steeped in a deep sense of humanism and an instinctive understanding of the symbiotic relationship between man and nature. Both in his paintings and sculptures, he pushed the limits of experimentation and ventured into the use of new materials. For instance, his use of unconventional material, for the time, such as cement concrete for his monumental public sculptures set a new precedent for art practices. The use of cement, laterite and mortar to model the figures, and the use of a personal style in which modern western and Indian pre-classical sculptural values were brought together was equally radical."

Brief Description,"Ramkinkar Baij’s artistic temperament was defined at Santiniketan an art institution known for providing an informed western modernistic environment to the students. Baij was immensely influenced by his austere surroundings, the ordinary people and nature that became the subject matter for painting, sculpture and printmaking. The above print depicts a figure overpowering the other. The composition is rendered with linear, firm yet fluid strokes incised on to a metal sheet. The lines are then transferred on the plain surface with the help of ink delineating the contours and suggesting the demeanour of the subjects."
Detailed Description,"Ramkinkar Baij was a reclusive modernist artist who always remained on the fringes of the art market. He took a great interest in human figures, body language and in the general human drama. Modern Western art and pre and post-classical Indian art were his main points of reference. Although primarily known for his expressionistic sculpture, he was also a gifted painter. The sense of rhythm that his sculpture was noted for, is manifested brilliantly in his watercolours. His works in the Kalighat tradition were interconnected with Cubism to achieve an unusual personal idiom. His sculpture, paintings and printmaking are unprompted and bold."

In 1925, he made his way to Kala Bhavana, the art school at Santiniketan and was under the guidance of Nandalal Bose. Encouraged by the liberating, intellectual environment of Santiniketan, his artistic skills and intellectual horizons blossomed, thus acquiring greater depth and complexity. Soon after completing his studies at Kala Bhavana he became a faculty member, and along with Nandalal Bose and Benodebehari Mukherjee played a pivotal role in making Santiniketan one of the most important centres for modern art in pre-Independent India. In 1970, the Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan for his irrefutable contribution to Indian art. Ramkinkar's monumental sculptures are established landmarks in public art. One of the earliest modernists in Indian art, he assimilated the idioms of the European modern visual language and yet was rooted in his own Indian ethos. He experimented restlessly with forms, moving freely from figurative to abstract and back to figurative, his themes were steeped in a deep sense of humanism and an instinctive understanding of the symbiotic relationship between man and nature. Both in his paintings and sculptures, he pushed the limits of experimentation and ventured into the use of new materials. For instance, his use of unconventional material, for the time, such as cement concrete for his monumental public sculptures set a new precedent for art practices. The use of cement, laterite and mortar to model the figures, and the use of a personal style in which modern western and Indian pre-classical sculptural values were brought together was equally radical."

Brief Description,"Ramkinkar Baij was a reclusive modernist artist who always remained on the fringes of the art market. He took a great interest in human figures, body language and in the general human drama. Modern Western art and pre and post-classical Indian art were his main points of reference. Although primarily known for his expressionistic sculpture, he was also a gifted painter. The sense of rhythm that his sculpture was noted for is manifested brilliantly in his paintings and sketches. His works in the Kalighat tradition interconnected with Cubism to achieve an unusual personal idiom. Both his sculpture and his paintings are unprompted and bold."

Artist's Life Date / Bio Data,"Ramkinkar Baij, one of the most seminal artists of modern India, was an iconic sculptor, painter and graphic artist. Ramkinkar Baij (1906-1980) was born in Bankura, West Bengal, into a family of little economic and social standing and grew by his sheer determination into one of the most distinguished early modernists of Indian art. In 1925, he made his way to Kala Bhavana, the art school at Santiniketan and was under the guidance of Nandalal Bose. Encouraged by the liberating, intellectual environment of Santiniketan, his artistic skills and intellectual horizons blossomed, thus acquiring greater depth and complexity. Soon after completing his studies at Kala Bhavana he became a faculty member, and along with Nandalal Bose and Benodebehari Mukherjee played a pivotal role in making Santiniketan one of the most important centres for modern art in pre-Independent India. In 1970, the Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan for his irrefutable contribution to Indian art. Ramkinkar's monumental sculptures are established landmarks in public art. One of the earliest modernists in Indian art, he assimilated the idioms of the European modern visual language and yet was rooted in his own Indian ethos. He experimented restlessly with forms, moving freely from figurative to abstract and back to figurative, his themes were steeped in a deep sense of humanism and an instinctive understanding of the symbiotic relationship between man and nature. Both in his paintings and sculptures, he pushed the limits of experimentation and ventured into the use of new materials. For instance, his use of unconventional material, for the time, such as cement concrete for his monumental public sculptures set a new precedent for art practices. The use of cement, laterite and mortar to model the figures, and the use of a personal style in which modern western and Indian pre-classical sculptural values were brought together was equally radical."

Although primarily known for his expressionistic sculpture, he was also a gifted painter. The sense of rhythm that his sculpture was noted for, is manifested brilliantly in his watercolours. His works in the Kalighat tradition interconnected with Cubism to achieve an unusual personal idiom. Both his sculpture and his paintings are unprompted and bold."

Main Artist,Abanindranath Tagore (1871 - 1951)
Artist's Nationality,Indian
Artist's Life Date / Bio Data,"Abanindranath was born in the creatively distinguished family of Tagores of Jorasanko in Kolkata. In his youth, Abanindranath received training in European and Academic style from European artists, Olinto Gilhardi and C.E.Palmer. But sometime during the last decade of the 19th century, he developed distaste for the corporeality of European naturalism. Coincidentally, about the same time he received an album of Mughal miniatures and a book of English poems illuminated in the Art Nouveau style. These influenced Abanindranath's visual ideas deeply. A third source of inspiration came from the visit of the Japanese philosopher and aesthetician Okakura Kakuzo to Kolkata in 1902. Okakura's visit led to the coming of the Japanese artists Taikan and Hishida in 1903. The two Japanese artists taught Abanindranath the wash technique which appealed to the artists' romanticism.
These various triggers led Abanindranath to evolve a distinctive visual language that was delicate, sensitive, dreamy and rich in atmosphere he synthesized in his paintings the Western and Eastern aesthetics. Although, Abanindranath painted a range of subjects, he had a leaning towards painting images with historic or literary allusions. He liked to paint sets of images dealing with a theme or a text such as the 'Arabian Nights' or the 'Krishna Leela'. He also enjoyed painting theatrical subjects. Literature and drama held great respect for him and he was an elegant and accomplished writer. Towards his sunset years, he started making whimsical sculptures with found material like driftwood. The NGMA has a few of his these works."

Artist's Life Date / Bio Data,"Born in 1910 in Indore, Madhya Pradesh, Narayan Shridhar Bendre attended the State Art School, Indore before getting his Government Diploma in Art from Bombay in 1933. Bendre as an artist avidly practiced landscapes and portraits in an academic style in oil and gouache, particularly conceptualising the village folks and the underprivileged class of the society in the early phase of his artistic career. N. S. Bendre also worked in the company of Nandalal Bose, Ram Kinkar Baij and Benod Behari Mukherjee during his stay in Santiniketan as an Artist in Residence in the year 1945. An ardent traveller, Bendre made a journey in 1947-48 to USA, Europe and other foreign countries getting acquainted with the works of modern masters of the West. The artist then experimented with cubism and expressionism assimilating them with traditional Indian classical and folk art styles. In his later years, in the 1960s, Bendre adopted the Neo- impressionistic technique of pointillism in his works eliminating the details and paying more attention to creating an overall sensory experience in his compositions. N S Bendre joined the Progressive Artists Group, Bombay in 1948. He started teaching at the Faculty of Fine Arts, Baroda in 1950 and later became the Dean of the Faculty of Painting in 1959. One of the famous works- 'Thorn', done during this time in cubist fashion, got the National Award by Lalit Kala Akademi, Delhi in 1955. N. S. Bendre received the Padma Shri Award from the President of India in 1969 and was also awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1991."

Artist's Life Date / Bio Data,"Born in 1945 in the small town of Uttar Pradesh in Neoli, Gogi Saroj Pal studied at the College of Art in Vanasthali, Rajasthan as well as the College of Art in Lucknow. She works in many media, including gouache, oil, ceramic and weaving. Her works usually have women as their subject, and many of her paintings have a fantastical element that still comments on the female condition. Her early works were more realistic, but over time she has moved to simpler, more stylized paintings that have considerable impact. The iconography of woman is an important feature of Gogi Saroj Pal's work and her images are not devoid of context. The status of women in society and nuances of their degradation find reflection in her work."

Main Artist,Hore Somnath
Artist's Nationality,Indian
Artist's Life Date / Bio Data,"Hailing from the small village of Barama, Chittagong( presently Bangladesh) , Somnath Hore, born in 1921 started painting for the Communist party . He painted scenes of war on the documentation including Bengal famine and Tebhaga Movement which were based on the agitation between the landlords and the tenants in 1948.During this uprising , Hore came in contact of Chittaprosad Bhattacharya , who himself was a print maker and a strategist. Later his joining at the Government College of Art and Craft , Calcutta in 1954 made him learn the printmaking techniques of lithography and intaglio . At then, Haren Das was the acting head of the graphics department which gave Hore the advantage of learning from him. Hore came up with an invention of the paper pulp printing along with various amalgamations of different media which gave him utter recognition. His series of abstract paper pulp 'Wounds' fetch him a number of accolades and appreciation. Later he moved to Santiniketan, worked for Kala Bhawan . His association with K.G. Subramanyam and Ramkinkar Baij at the Viswa Bharati University results in his inclination towards the sculptures. He contorted the sculptures in bronze. He also headed the Graphics Department of College of Art, Delhi along with the visiting experience as a faculty in M.S.U. Baroda."
Country,India
Dimensions,8.5 x 9.5 cm
Brief Description,"Somnath Hore's works are filled by humanist eye, inclination towards empathy, and his communist ideology. Tension in lines and emaciating figures were significant in most of his works. He was driven with the feeling of anguished and suffering of the poor. The overall impression one gets from his works is the depth of poverty he has starved in. In this print, he has rendered a boy sitting and posing in front of the still life with fine, firm yet fluid strokes incised on to a metal sheet and transferred on the plain surface with the help of ink, articulating the contours of the figures."
Detailed Description,"Somnath Hore is remembered because of his creativity and excellence in inventing new media of printing techniques. Though Gaganendranath Tagore was the father of Indian printmaking, Hore made his presence felt immensely in it. The depiction of the sufferings and atrocities of the poor and the anguished figures with a placement of soaring birds and animals occupy most of the art works produced. His experiments with various print-making techniques and mediums such as etching, intaglio and lithographs led him to develop a new medium called 'Pulp-prints'."

Main Artist,Somnath Hore
Artist's Nationality,Indian
Artist's Life Date / Bio Data,"Hailing from the small village of Barama, Chittagong( presently Bangladesh) , Somnath Hore, born in 1921 started painting for the Communist party . He painted scenes of war on the documentation including Bengal famine and Tebhaga Movement which were based on the agitation between the landlords and the tenants in 1948.During this uprising , Hore came in contact of Chittaprosad Bhattacharya , who himself was a print maker and a strategist. Later his joining at the Government College of Art and Craft , Calcutta in 1954 made his learn the printmaking techniques of lithography and intaglio . At then Haren Das was the acing head of the graphics department which gave Hore the advantage of learning from him. Hore came up with an invention in the paper pulp printing along with various amalgamations of different media which gave him utter recognition. His series of abstract paper pulp 'Wounds'fetch him a number of accolades and appreciation. Later he moved to Santi niketan , worked for Kala Bhawan . His association with K.G. Subramanyam and Ram Kinker Baij at the Viswa Bharati University resulted his inclination towards the sculptures. He contorted the sculptures in bronze. He headed the Graphics Department of College of Art, Delhi. Also he went to M.S.U. Baroda and Indian College of Draughtsmanship"
Period / Year of Work,1967
Dimensions,26 X 29 cms
Brief Description,"Hore's work are filled by
humanist eye, inclination towards empathy, and his communist ideology. Tension
in lines and emaciating figures were significant in most of his works. He was
driven with the feeling of anguished and suffering of the poor. The overall
impression one gets from Somnath’s works is the depth of poverty he has starved
in. He used knives and red-hot rods to cut and burn into a piece of clay, which
then provided the basis for a cement mould that would shape and scar the paper
pulp. He moulded the white paper to form wound-like gashes,
and stained them with red blood-like pigment. The haunted imagery, blisters of the restrained figures made him
poignant among others. Hore stated,' I do not make pictures, I make 'wounds'
indeed."
Detailed Description,"Somnath Hore is remembered because of his creativity and excellence in inventing new media of printing techniques. Though Gaganendranath Tagore was the father of Indian printmaking, Hore made his presence felt immensely in it. The depiction of the sufferings and atrocities of the poor and the anguished figures with a placement of soaring birds and animals occupy most of the art works produced. His experiments with various print-making techniques and mediums such as etching, intaglio and lithographs led him to develop a new medium called 'Pulp-prints'."

Artist's Nationality,Indian
Artist's Life Date / Bio Data,"Krishna Reddy was born in Chitoor, Andhra Pradesh on 15 July 1925. He studied art at the Vishwa-Bharati University, Santiniketan, West Bengal under the tutelage of Nandalal Bose. From 1947 to 1950 he headed the art section at Kalakshetra, Chennai. Later, Reddy travelled to Europe where he spent most of his impressionable years. From  1951 to 1952 he continued his studies at Slade School of Fine Arts, University of London. It was here that he studied sculpture under Ossip Zadkine and Marino Marini in Milan and engraving under Stanley William Hayter in Paris. While studying under Hayter, Reddy started assisting him and soon became an Associate Director of the printmaking studio Atelier 17, as well as in the studios of Henry Moore in England, Marino Marini in Italy and Ossip Zadkine in Paris. It was at Atelier 17 that he first began to develop his unique printmaking technique. Krishna Reddy is a known master of  intaglio printmaking and has been a guest professor at many top-ranking universities in the USA. Reddy received the Padma Shri in 1972, in recognition of his distinguished contributions to art. His works can be found in several private and public collections, including the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, the National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi, the Museum of Modern Art, New York, the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, the Albertina Museum, Vienna, and the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC. Krishna Reddy lives and works out of Paris and United States of America."
Country,India
Inscription,"Signed 'Krishna Reddy' along the lower margin of the print. There is also an inscription in English that reads, 'Three Graces' along the lower margin."
Brief Description,"Krishna Reddy's prints have an emphasis on line to express the physical form of his subjects infused with vibrant hues. In the above abstract print Reddy has depicted the Greek mythological characters of the three graces, goddesses of charm, beauty, and creativity. It is an alluring example of Reddy's mastery over the viscosity technique of printmaking. A process that uses the principle of viscosity to print multiple colours of ink from a single plate, rather than relying upon multiple plates for colour separation."
Detailed Description,"Krishna Reddy is an internationally acclaimed printmaker and sculptor known for his path-breaking work in revolutionising graphic art and printmaking in the US and India. His prints often revolve around subjects from nature, besides human figures and abstract themes. The artist counts print maker Giacommetti as a major influence on him, one that resulted in his now familiar vocabulary of vertically and horizontally extended images."

in. He used knives and red-hot rods to cut and burn into a piece of clay, which
then provided the basis for a cement mould that would shape and scar the paper
pulp. He moulded the white paper to form wound-like gashes,
and stained them with red blood-like pigment. The haunted imagery, blisters of the restrained figures made him
poignant among others. Hore stated,' I do not make pictures, I make 'wounds'
indeed."
Detailed Description,"Somnath Hore is remembered because of his creativity and excellence in inventing new media of printing techniques. Though Gaganendranath Tagore was the father of Indian printmaking, Hore made his presence felt immensely in it. The depiction of the sufferings and atrocities of the poor and the anguished figures with a placement of soaring birds and animals occupy most of the art works produced. His experiments with various print-making techniques and mediums such as etching, intaglio and lithographs led him to develop a new medium called 'Pulp-prints'."

Main Artist,Ramkinkar Baij
Artist's Nationality,Indian
Artist's Life Date / Bio Data,"Ramkinkar Baij, one of the most seminal artists of modern India, was an iconic sculptor, painter and graphic artist. Ramkinkar Baij (1906-1980) was born in Bankura, West Bengal, into a family of little economic and social standing and grew by his sheer determination into one of the most distinguished early modernists of Indian art. In 1925, he made his way to Kala Bhavana, the art school at Santiniketan and was under the guidance of Nandalal Bose. Encouraged by the liberating, intellectual environment of Santiniketan, his artistic skills and intellectual horizons blossomed, thus acquiring greater depth and complexity. Soon after completing his studies at Kala Bhavana he became a faculty member, and along with Nandalal Bose and Benodebehari Mukherjee played a pivotal role in making Santiniketan one of the most important centres for modern art in pre-Independent India. In 1970, the Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan for his irrefutable contribution to Indian art. Ramkinkar's monumental sculptures are established landmarks in public art. One of the earliest modernists in Indian art, he assimilated the idioms of the European modern visual language and yet was rooted in his own Indian ethos. He experimented restlessly with forms, moving freely from figurative to abstract and back to figurative, his themes were steeped in a deep sense of humanism and an instinctive understanding of the symbiotic relationship between man and nature. Both in his paintings and sculptures, he pushed the limits of experimentation and ventured into the use of new materials. For instance, his use of unconventional material, for the time, such as cement concrete for his monumental public sculptures set a new precedent for art practices. The use of cement, laterite and mortar to model the figures, and the use of a personal style in which modern western and Indian pre-classical sculptural values were brought together was equally radical."
Country,India
Inscription,Signed 'Ramkinkar' in Bengali in the bottom-left corner of the painting. The painting also bears an inscription in 'Bengali ' which can be translated as 'Shillong' referring to the name of the place.
Brief Description,"Ramkinkar Baij
selected images for his sculptures and paintings from his rural surroundings.
The poor and the downtrodden figured primarily as his subjects. Baij's
watercolours mostly reflect his preoccupation with nature and the animal world.
His work is characterized by tremendous energy, dynamism and the use of earthy
colours. In the above painting, the artist has depicted a landscape with dabs
and dashes of watercolour in tonal variation delineating the form."
Detailed Description,"Ramkinkar Baij was a reclusive modernist artist who always remained on the fringes of the art market. He took a great interest in human figures, body language and in the general human drama. Modern Western art and pre and post-classical Indian art were his main point of reference. Although primarily known for his expressionistic sculpture, he was also a gifted painter. The sense of rhythm that his sculpture was noted for, is manifested brilliantly in his watercolours. His works in the Kalighat tradition interconnected with Cubism to achieve an unusual personal idiom. Both his sculpture and his paintings are unprompted and bold."

Artist's Life Date / Bio Data,"Born in Delhi in 1945, Jai Zharotia never held his creativity a captive of logic and reason. His freedom of spirit let him move beyond their confines enabling him to conjure up the powerfully evocative and communicative images we see in his work today. He didn't want to paint only the comprehensible, but instead wanted to discover and explore the world that lies beyond the realms of logic. The idea of duality in the iconography finds a place in all of his recent works. It pervades every aspect of the pieces, operating between what we see and what is hidden, what stands out blatantly and what evades our attention, as well as between the different levels of consciousness. Almost as if it is testing us and playing tricks on our senses. But even though an apparent structural divide exists in his paintings, they do not lack any dynamic energy. Zharotia makes sure that they go through a constant reconstruction and reinterpretation within themselves as well as within our minds."

Main Artist,Ben Willikens
Artist's Life Date / Bio Data,"Born in 1939 in Leipzig, Germany, Ben Willikens became known for his paintings of deserted spaces where time seems to stand still. He studies philosophy and literature in Hamburg and in 1962 he moved to the State Academy of Fine Arts in Stuttgart , where he studied painting with Heinz TrÃ?Â¶kes .For a long time gray dominated his palette, and his subtle orchestration of three-dimensional light drew both viewers and interpreters who found a ""theatre of absence in his work. In 1982 he becomes professor of painting and graphics at the Braunschweig University of the Arts . In 1991, he moved to the Munich Academy of Fine Arts , where he was the chairman of the Department of Painting and Graphics."
Country,Germany
Brief Description,"Ben Willikens has explored
the historical and symbolic dimensions of space in his paintings and prints for
more than four decades. Using clinical interiors, he has pursued the theme of
space, ranging from deserted variations of the Last Supper and its tectonic
antitheses to buildings constructed by the Nazis. He has attempts to comprehend
space as a metaphor for human sensibilities. "

Artist's Life Date / Bio Data,"Nandalal Bose, popularly known as the Master Moshai, was born on December 3rd, 1882 in Kharagpur, Monghyr District, Bihar. A disciple of Abanindranath Tagore, he graduated from Government School of Art, Calcutta in 1910. Nandalal was fascinated by the potential of folk art and indigenous modes of expression and inculcated them in his works although stylising them in a unique representation for depiction and narration of local life. His explorative temperament with artistic materials allowed him to create a vast body of work with printmaking techniques such as lithography, linoleum prints and Sino-Japanese techniques while remaining faithful to his narrative subject: India's environment and its ethos. Nandalal Bose's art conjures newness unbound, yet it is flushed with the memories of yesterday. Inspired by Far Eastern sensibilities that celebrate the traditional, the genius of his art lies in the interplay of sensual silhouettes and his powerful rendering of contemporary themes with the traditions, customs and sensibilities of Indian heritage. It is this intermingling that invigorates his works and captures the minds of his viewers. He began his artistic career in the fervour of the Swadeshi movement, rejecting western colonial norms of art and taking inspiration from the ancient murals of Ajanta and Bagh caves as well as Mughal miniatures. In 1919, Nandalal Bose accepted Rabindranath Tagore's invitation to become the Principal of the newly established art school Kala Bhavan at Visvabharati University in Santiniketan. He travelled in and out of India including places like Burma, China, Japan, Malaysia, Java and Sri Lanka seeking artistic stimulus from observing different cultural traditions. He also painted a series of posters for the Indian National Congress at Haripura in February 1938. The range of Nandalal's artistic expression is seen in his various landscapes with human figures, his varied images of nature and the Santiniketan Murals. His works reflect the changing landscape, portraying people and places at a time when modern India's cultural development was at its threshold. Nandalal Bose died on April 16th, 1966 in Santiniketan, West Bengal. He won several accolades including the Padma Vibhushan by the President of India in 1953. He was awarded with an honorary Doctorate in Letters (D. Litt.) from Banaras Hindu University in 1950 and Calcutta University in 1957. The NGMA has over 6800 of his works in its collection."

His nature to explore the various materials and mediums allowed him to make a prolific body of work in different mediums.  Along with the techniques of art he imbibed from the European indigenous tradition and the Japanese wash technique, he also explored the art of Rabindranath Tagore, Abnindranath, who was his teacher.  Thus the techniques of their art also reflect in Nandalal's visual expressions. This painting,  with the kind of the portrayal of the people and the rendering of the space on the paper, reflects the similitude with the Ajanta Murals which was the inspiration in Abanindranath's works also."

Artist's Life Date / Bio Data,"Nandalal Bose, popularly known as the Master Moshai, was born on December 3rd, 1882 in Kharagpur, Monghyr District, Bihar. A disciple of Abanindranath Tagore, he graduated from Government School of Art, Calcutta in 1910. Nandalal was fascinated by the potential of folk art and indigenous modes of expression and inculcated them in his works although stylising them in a unique representation for depiction and narration of local life. His explorative temperament with artistic materials allowed him to create a vast body of work with printmaking techniques such as lithography, linoleum prints and Sino-Japanese techniques while remaining faithful to his narrative subject: India's environment and its ethos. Nandalal Bose's art conjures newness unbound, yet it is flushed with the memories of yesterday. Inspired by Far Eastern sensibilities that celebrate the traditional, the genius of his art lies in the interplay of sensual silhouettes and his powerful rendering of contemporary themes with the traditions, customs and sensibilities of Indian heritage. It is this intermingling that invigorates his works and captures the minds of his viewers. He began his artistic career in the fervour of the Swadeshi movement, rejecting western colonial norms of art and taking inspiration from the ancient murals of Ajanta and Bagh caves as well as Mughal miniatures. In 1919, Nandalal Bose accepted Rabindranath Tagore's invitation to become the Principal of the newly established art school Kala Bhavan at Visvabharati University in Santiniketan. He travelled in and out of India including places like Burma, China, Japan, Malaysia, Java and Sri Lanka seeking artistic stimulus from observing different cultural traditions. He also painted a series of posters for the Indian National Congress at Haripura in February 1938. The range of Nandalal's artistic expression is seen in his various landscapes with human figures, his varied images of nature and the Santiniketan Murals. His works reflect the changing landscape, portraying people and places at a time when modern India's cultural development was at its threshold. Nandalal Bose died on April 16th, 1966 in Santiniketan, West Bengal. He won several accolades including the Padma Vibhushan by the President of India in 1953. He was awarded with an honorary Doctorate in Letters (D. Litt.) from Banaras Hindu University in 1950 and Calcutta University in 1957. The NGMA has over 6800 of his works in its collection."

Brief Description,"Nandalal is known to have fervently sketched on postcard sized papers mostly using ink and brush, recording his surroundings. The above sketch by the artist depicts a woman planting coconut palms in the field. The composition is rendered with fluid, soft brush strokes delineating the contours of her body and suggesting the demeanour of the subject."
Detailed Description,"Nandalal was indefatigable in his sketching routines which formed an adjunct part of his daily life. Making instantaneous visual records of anything amusing happening in his surround dings or of social events, or observing the demeanour and mannerisms of people, the cattle and observing intently the ways of nature was inspiring and a source of delight for Nanadalal. His smaller sketches are testimony of Nandalal's keenness to observe and his empathy for the environment in which he lived. Art historian R. Siva Kumar in the book, 'Rhythms of India: The Art of Nandalal Bose' has described the sketches and drawings of Nandalal as - ""Nandalal's drawing take through different landscapes and introduce us to life in different cultures- not cosmetically, but intimately. Done on small cards, these drawings are a visual record of the artist's sensory experiences, and they capture the varying moods and gestures with remarkable ease and economy."""

Brief Description,"Nandalal had a strong affinity for sketching and drawing, instantly recording in the postcard sized papers his subjects from the surrounding environs, people in their everyday life, or anything he found fascinating. In this painting, he has depicted a woman hiding behind a trunk of a tree against the background of orange- red, rendered with shades of flat color in tonal variation delineating the forms."
Detailed Description,"After the mid-1950s and until his death in 1966, Nandalal's work became increasingly personal and introspective. During this time, Nandalal painted from his experiences and memory, barely leaving his studio in Santiniketan. Paintings of this phase became almost minimalistic and abstract yet never losing the inherent meditative or the spontaneous quality. This final phase in Nandalal's long and fruitful career is characterised by a consistent technique the artist employed using a Japanese brush and ink (sumi) and making only monochromatic ink drawings and watercolour paintings known as Sumi-e. The subjects were no longer mythological or iconic instead they all pertain to nature. Through twirls, swirls, dabs and dashes, he ventured to depict rhythm in the elements of nature and the relationship between nature and himself. These paintings are incredibly minimalistic depicting birds, plants, trees, hills, mountains, waves, animals, sun, moon, clouds, wind and flowers through vivid brush strokes, leaving large empty spaces."

Brief Description,"Nandalal preferred drawing
from life, often sketching outdoors with the subject being life, nature
studies, landscapes, figure drawings, animals or anything that he found

In the above painting Nandalal has sketched a view of Parasnath Hill, with a technique he termed 'touch work',  referring to the spontaneous calligraphic strokes that describe the object of the painting. The sublime scenery is delineated with simple strokes of colours to model and add vigour to the composition.  "
Detailed Description,"Nandalal Bose had a firm belief that for the creation of art an intimate understanding of nature and its ways is imperative. This particular album from the collection of the National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi showcases his search for newer forms of expression and his inner urge to constantly innovate with various subjects and media. Dinkar Kowshik in an article 'Drawings and Sketches of Nandalal' in the book, 'Nandalal Bose - A Collection of Essays' writes, ""He (Nandalal) was indefatigable in his search for form and to the end of his life he remained a student. Whatever he saw, and wherever he went he recorded the flora and fauna, the people of the place, their dress, their carriages, the headdresses, the landscape, the festivals, the architecture; and while doing that he went on attaining a felicity of expression."""

Artist's Life Date / Bio Data,"Nandalal Bose, popularly known as the Master Moshai, was born on December 3rd, 1882 in Kharagpur, Monghyr District, Bihar. A disciple of Abanindranath Tagore, he graduated from Government School of Art, Calcutta in 1910. Nandalal was fascinated by the potential of folk art and indigenous modes of expression and inculcated them in his works although stylising them in a unique representation for depiction and narration of local life. His explorative temperament with artistic materials allowed him to create a vast body of work with printmaking techniques such as lithography, linoleum prints and Sino-Japanese techniques while remaining faithful to his narrative subject: India's environment and its ethos. Nandalal Bose's art conjures newness unbound, yet it is flushed with the memories of yesterday. Inspired by Far Eastern sensibilities that celebrate the traditional, the genius of his art lies in the interplay of sensual silhouettes and his powerful rendering of contemporary themes with the traditions, customs and sensibilities of Indian heritage. It is this intermingling that invigorates his works and captures the minds of his viewers. He began his artistic career in the fervour of the Swadeshi movement, rejecting western colonial norms of art and taking inspiration from the ancient murals of Ajanta and Bagh caves as well as Mughal miniatures. In 1919, Nandalal Bose accepted Rabindranath Tagore's invitation to become the Principal of the newly established art school Kala Bhavan at Visvabharati University in Santiniketan.

Artist's Life Date / Bio Data,"Nandalal Bose, popularly known as the Master Moshai, was born on December 3rd, 1882 in Kharagpur, Monghyr District, Bihar. A disciple of Abanindranath Tagore, he graduated from Government School of Art, Calcutta in 1910. Nandalal was fascinated by the potential of folk art and indigenous modes of expression and inculcated them in his works although stylising them in a unique representation for depiction and narration of local life. His explorative temperament with artistic materials allowed him to create a vast body of work with printmaking techniques such as lithography, linoleum prints and Sino-Japanese techniques while remaining faithful to his narrative subject: India's environment and its ethos. Nandalal Bose's art conjures newness unbound, yet it is flushed with the memories of yesterday. Inspired by Far Eastern sensibilities that celebrate the traditional, the genius of his art lies in the interplay of sensual silhouettes and his powerful rendering of contemporary themes with the traditions, customs and sensibilities of Indian heritage. It is this intermingling that invigorates his works and captures the minds of his viewers. He began his artistic career in the fervour of the Swadeshi movement, rejecting western colonial norms of art and taking inspiration from the ancient murals of Ajanta and Bagh caves as well as Mughal miniatures. In 1919, Nandalal Bose accepted Rabindranath Tagore's invitation to become the Principal of the newly established art school Kala Bhavan at Visvabharati University in Santiniketan. He travelled in and out of India including places like Burma, China, Japan, Malaysia, Java and Sri Lanka seeking artistic stimulus from observing different cultural traditions. He also painted a series of posters for the Indian National Congress at Haripura in February 1938. The range of Nandalal's artistic expression is seen in his various landscapes with human figures, his varied images of nature and the Santiniketan Murals. His works reflect the changing landscape, portraying people and places at a time when modern India's cultural development was at its threshold. Nandalal Bose died on April 16th, 1966 in Santiniketan, West Bengal. He won several accolades including the Padma Vibhushan by the President of India in 1953. He was awarded with an honorary Doctorate in Letters (D. Litt.) from Banaras Hindu University in 1950 and Calcutta University in 1957. The NGMA has over 6800 of his works in its collection."

Brief Description,"This painting
belongs to a series of monochromatic ink and watercolour paintings inspired by
the Sumi-e Japanese technique the artist employed in the last phase of his
life. These compositions were stripped to the bare minimum where only a few
strokes of ink were employed to create natural forms in an effortless approach.
In the above painting Nandalal has executed two fishermen floating the canoe. He
has used similar brushwork in the rendering of the sea and the figures, thus
conveying the idea of nature and humans as different expression of the same
underlying unity. This painting was purchased from the collection of Shri
Biswaroop Bose and Smt. Nivedita Bose, children of Nandalal Bose."
Detailed Description,"Nandalal's search for newer forms of expression and his inner urge to constantly innovate is well reflected in the multiple postcards in the collection of the museum which portray the artist's visual experiences of the flora, fauna, people, attires, life in rural villages and the country's myriad landscapes. Dinkar Kowshik in his article 'Drawings and Sketches of Nandalal' in the book, 'Nandalal Bose - A Collection of Essays' writes of Nandalal's sketches and drawings, ""Much of his (Nandalal) strength and sensitive wealth finds expression in the spontaneity of his sketches. They are a veritable treasure of shrewd observation, powerful calligraphy, psychological insight, rich sallies of humour and emphatic portrayal of the flora and fauna."""
