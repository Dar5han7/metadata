above, and is surrounded by a narrow band of floral buds. The 
uppermost plain section of the post bears an inscription: Pusasa

of the Buddha in the sala forest at Lumbini, in which case the main

further reinforced if the creature represented on the stambha were 
indeed a horse as it has been conjectured that the pillar set up by 
Asoka at Lumbini was crowned by a horse capital.","Fragment of an architrave. Beginning from the kleft it shows

must have stood erect with the weight equally distributed 
on both feet. The shoulders are broad; and the torso, 
except for a slight protuberance at the belly, is flat.
           The workmanship is very similar to Bharhut, 
particularly in the stiff line and cubical form. Even 
though the image is technically carved in the round it is 
essentially a bilateral relief, more so than any of the 
other free standing Yaksas of this period.""","Lotus leaves and buds emerge from the sides of the lunate and are 
carved along the bevelled edge. The base of the post, which is 
roughly dressed, was embedded in the ground.","Female bust with hair arranged backward and tied with a fillet.

(A) Abacus of a capital of a pillar bearing honeysuckle motifs and a beaded border.
(B) The bell shaped lower portion which is broken into two parts has upturned petals is said to have been made during the reign of Jahangir.","The medallion on the cross-bar takes the form of a lotus with a 
double row of petals. The reverse also carries a similar lotus 
medallion.","Cross bar showing lotus flowrs with a little different treatment on 
both of its faces. there is a small flower carved in low relief on 
front side where as on other side instead of central rays a series 
of superimposed buds are shown around the pericaps.","Pillar fragment showing part of a lotus, petals of which alternate 
with blue lotuses. They are also encased in a border made by a 
series of overlapping leaves. Right bevelled side contains a lotus 
surmounted by human feet.","Coping stone fragment with an undulating creeper carved on 
it. There are several scenes inside the panels. First shows a 
railing fixed on a long post and second, presents three human 
figures, a tree and a person who holds some creeper(?)","Only a small portion of the uppermost section of the post is preserved, its decoration consisting of a large lotus lunate surmounted by a band of oversecting lotuses with beaded edges.",Between the usual borders a horse with a rider is shown wearing a fillet around the head. To the left are plump mangoes are issuing from the kalpavalli.,"In the foreground is a tank with two fishes, and above it is a 
blazing hearth towards which jumps a small animal, most probably 
a hare. To the proper right are two baskets of mangoes; to the 
left, behind the hare, are an otter and a lizard. Above these 
can be discerned the legs of another animal, a spouted jar, and 
the knees of a cross-legged seated figure.
            The scene undoubtedly illustrates the Sasa Jataka 
which relates how once when King Brahmadatta was reigning in 
Banaras the Bodhisattva lived in the forest as a young hare. The 
hare had three friends, a jackal, an otter, and a monkey. The 
hare advised his friends to give alms, to observe the sacred 
law, and honour the holy days. One day all the four went to the 
woods. The otter collected fish; the monkey gathered mangoes; 
and the jackal took a lizard and a pot of curds from the house 
of a watchman, but the hare could not collect anything. Sakka 
appeared in disguise, begging food from the hare, who offered 
him his body, having nothing else to give. The hare jumped into 
the fire, but miraculously would not burn.
             The Jataka is also represented at Nagarjunikonda 
(MASI No.54, Pl. XVIII) and Amaravati (Fergusson, Tree and & 
srepent Worship, Pl. LXXXII, Fig. 2).","The edges of the pillar have been cut away, the feet and 
arms of 
the Yaksi are missing, and her face and chest are damaged. 
Holes 
were drilled on top of the post and her forehead when the 
pillar 
was adapted for later use. The Yaksi wears a diaphanous 
lower 
garment clasped to the waist by a multi-stranded girdle, the 
loose end of which falls in rows of pleats between the legs. 
A 
sash is loosely tied over the hip and knotted at the girdle. 
The 
hair is covered with a coif which is crossed over the 
forehead, 
and decorated with a branch of leaves over the left temple. 
The 
slight projection above the center of the forehead may 
indicate 
the presence of a crest jewel The earrings are square blocks 
with spiral loops (prakara-vapra-kundala), and among the 
other 
ornaments are a many-stranded collar, worn over a longer 
necklace, now barely visible, and an upvita strung with 
cylindrical amulet cases and a circular jewelled pendant.                                                                                                                   
The top of the post is decorated with a large lotus lunate, 
surmounted by a band filled with a lotus rhizome.",Coping stone fragment with lotus creeper decoration on one side and an undulating creeper on the other side. A big jack fruit is shown hanging from it. A peepal and a banyan tree are carved inside the panel under which there are two deer? A human figure is present inside the foliage of banyan tree. Usual border decoration.,"The lower portion and most of the beveled sides of the post 
have 
been cut off. On the top is a lunate with a full-blown lotus 
bordered by a cable molding of twisted and jeweled floral 
garlands (dama-yugala), surmounted by a band of alternating 
stepped pyramids and blue lotuses.
 Although only half the central medallion is preserved and 
what 
survives is damaged, it is of unusual design. Above a girdle 
like band of cloth is a small central rosette surrounded by 
a 
circular band divided into triangles and filled with 
diagonal 
lines probably representing water. Above is a tri-ratna 
symbol, 
apparently resting on a jeweled cloth. The motif is composed 
of 
two fish-tailed makaras, their joined snouts forming the 
central 
prong which supports a blue lotus while their curved tails 
form 
the side prongs. Mango fruits and garlands also hang on 
these 
tails. At the sides are what appear to be the coiled bodies 
of 
Nagas. 
 The bevelled edges of the post bear traces of Yaksa and 
Yaksi 
figures.","Only a small portion of the pillar shaft remains, and though the 
original polish is absent, the characteristically refined Mauryan 
workmanship is clear.","The decoration consists of an upper border of blue lotuses 
alternating with stepped pyramids now missing, a broad 
central 
band filled with a lotus rhizome, and a lower border 
consisting 
of a row of bells alternating with jeweled buds, both 
hanging 
from beaded chains that cross each other to form a 
continuous 
row of lozenges. The rhizome itself shows a broad undulating 
stalk from the nodes of which break forth intermeshing side 
stems bearing large full-blown lotus flowers, and subsidiary 
leaves and buds. The flower is naturalistically conceived 
consisting of a central pistil marked with small circles, 
rosettes, and other floral marks and ringed by stamens 
followed 
by two concentric rows of petals. The closed buds are 
conical in 
shape and the cup-shaped leaves are frilled at the edges.","To the left is a four-stranded necklace with an oblong spacer in 
the center of each strand; also to be seen are a spiral bracelet 
or anklet, a jewelled rosette, and a forehead medallion. To the 
right is a Naga with hood raised, and a group of human figures 
only the feet of which are preserved. The lower border consists 
of the usual chain-and-bell motif.","The kalpavalli is shown yielding a waist sash, and Nagas are to be seen in the panel on the right. The usual chain-and-bell motif comprises the lower border.","All that is preserved of the post is a small portion of the bevelled 
edge on which is carved a lotus with drooping petals and the head of 
a gazelle.","Only a small portion of the upper section including the tenon for 
setting the rail coping is preserved. The lunate consists of a 
lotus bordered by a row of smaller open lotuses separated from 
each other by pairs of blue lotuses. Above is a band composed of 
the usual blue lotus and stepped pyramid motif. The lunate on the 
reverse also contains a lotus and a similar band above.","Pillar fragment, shows the stalks of blue lotuses and a half lotus decoration.","Below the usual border of stepped pyramids are traces of a 
relief panel depicting two birds, one a goose and the other a 
peacock with tail outspread. The inscription reads: 
hamsajatakam, the Jataka of the goose. Cunningham, however, 
identified the scene correctly as an illustration of the Naccha 
Jataka in which the golden goose permits his daughter to pick 
her own husband. She chooses the peacock who dances with joy at 
this good fortune but unfortunately in so doing immodestly 
exposes his private parts, whereupon be ii refused the bride.",Coping stone fragment from the inner side showing a partly cut lotus flower with scroll and a chain of hanging bells below it.,"Above the lunate, which has the usual lotus flower, are pairs of 
geese separated by blue lotuses. The stone tenon for holding the 
coping is preserved.
         The reverse also bears a lotus lunate, the band on top 
consisting of a honey-suckle flower flanked by fish-tailed 
makaras.","To the left is a horse with raised forelegs; the lotus leaves bear 
a sash and a beaded necklace. On the reverse is the usual lotus 
rhizome.","Fragment of the lotus medallion showing the right part of a 
human bust. He holds some object with both of his hand.","Pillar showing in the middle a lotus flower. A border comprises of 
palmettes is present on each of bevelled sides. A small fragment 
later joined to it.","The lower portion and beveled sides have been cut off. The post is 
much worn, but the central lotus medallion and the lotus flower in 
the upper lunate can be seen.","The lady in the lunate wears a multi-stranded necklace, 
earrings, and what appears to be a turban, the loose end 
of which is seen fluttering to the side. She peeps over a 
curtain which has been pulled down with the hand; in the 
other hand she holds a twig with leaves. The face is 
heavily tattooed, the patterns including a crescent moon 
on the right cheek.
         Along the bevelled edges are suspended long 
clusters of jewelled buds which are touched by Yaksis who 
undoubtedly stood on lotuses issuing from the sides of the 
central medallion, now missing.","Although the lower half of the post is missing, enough of 
the 
central medallion remains for us to discern a human pyramid, 
composed of four tiers of men, the topmost figure and the 
two 
supporting him being carved outside the medallion. On either 
side are Yaksa and Yaksi figures on a lotus. Above is a 
lotus 
lunate, surmounted by a band of honeysuckle flowers resting 
on 
their sides.","The lower portion and bevelled sides of the post have been cut off. On 
the top is a lunate decorated with a motif of rare occurrence at 
Bharhut, a stellate pattern, the interstices being filled with turtles 
and four-petaled flowers. The lower medallion has an altar and 
footprints shaded by a polysepalous Naga beneath the Bodhi tree. The 
scene is thus to be identified as a representation of the Naga 
Mucilinda protecting the Buddha from the rains after the Enlightenment.","It is a fragment of the inner face of a coping stone of the Bharhut 
railing. Between the usual upper and lower borders of stepped 
pyramids and pendant bells of the coping stone are reliefs which 
fill the four compartments formed by the undulating creepers 
(kalpavalli). Beginning from the left, we first see a calyx 
yielding a cloth, probably a lower garment; and two men engaged in 
conversation within a courtyard formed by three buildings, the 
structure to the right having three finials. The figure on the left 
has the right hand raised in the attitude of exposition while the 
left hand holds an animal. He is conversing with the figure on the 
right, who listens attentively. Another animal can be seen perched 
on the roof of the house in the foreground. This roof is gabled, 
consisting of sloping rafters thatched with grass; the other two 
roofs are vaulted and supported lengthwise by wooden beams, the 
ends of which are visible. A circular earring decorated with 
grooved concentric circles is used as space filler just above the 
building on the right. The adjoining panel shows the creeper 
emitting a four-stranded necklace, circular bangles, and a dancer's 
anklet (?) fringed with bells. The panel on the far right contains 
a hut, octagonal in plan, and provided with a domical roof having a 
finial made of lashed sticks.
 Above the two standing figures in conversation is inscribed 
gajajataka saso, and above the domed hut can be discerned the word 
jatake; translated by Luders as ""the Jataka of the elephant. The 
hare.., in the Jataka (?)"".","In the center of the lotus medallion, and framed by the stamens, 
a male head is made with protruding eyes and wearing a turban 
with a large knot. He also wears a torque, a collar, and 
earrings. A similar head framed by a lotus is on the reverse, 
the collar having a decoration of overlapping rosettes.","Coping stone fragment showing a border of stepped merlons 
attenated by blue lotuses at the top.. Within the loop formed by 
the lotus rhizome is an elephant with two riders, the driver 
balancing a reliquary casket on the beast's head with one hand, 
and holding a goad with the other. The man, seated far to the 
back, holds a banner. The elephant is caparisoned with a rich 
cloth decorated with four-petaled flowers and weighted by bells 
attached to the front corner. The head of the elephant is adorned 
with a beaded fillet on which are strung ornamental axe-heads.
          The scenes may refer to the division of the corporal 
relics of the Buddha, and perhaps formed part of a processional 
scene, the tail of yet another elephant being visible to the left.","Within the lower lunate is a pot-bellied Yaksa seated with 
legs crossed. He is shown pulling out of his mouth a heavy 
lotus stalk which is endowed with a profusion of subsidiary 
shoots terminating in lotus flowers, buds, and leaves. The top 
of the lunate is open and the lotus rhizome with full-blown 
flowers undoubtedly traveled along the center of the post as 
in AM 11. The sides of the post are beveled and a blue lotus, 
above which are honeysuckle ornaments, can be seen on either 
side. The reverse is almost identical.","At the base of the post is a seated Yaksa shown pulling a heavy 
lotus stalk from his mouth. The sides of the post are not beveled. 
They are bordered by bead - and - reel bands. The reverse is badly 
damaged, but bears a Yaksa at the base from whose navel issue lotus 
stalks. He carries a cup in the left hand. Both sides of the post 
have sockets for holding cross-bars.","Fragment of a medallion showing the head of a horse in high 
relief.","The lower portion of the post bears lotus lunates on both sides but 
is otherwise badly damaged. The roughly worked base is preserved.","Both sides bear lower lotus lunates with lotuses sprouting at the 
sides. The roughly worked base is preserved.","Only the lower portion of the post remains. Geese are shown on 
lotuses sprouting from the lunate at the base. On the reverse is 
another lunate with blue lotuses.","The central medallion is filled with a lotus. On the beveled 
edges are lotuses with drooping petals, one of them bearing 
the figure of a Yaksi holding an end of her sash. The reverse 
of the post is badly damaged, but the lunate at the base 
contains a fleur-de-lis motif, above the central leaf of which 
is a full-blown lotus flanked by large cup-shaped leaves.","This was undoubtedly one of the terminal or corner posts of the 
railing and its returns at the four gateways, as it is decorated 
on two adjacent faces. Unfortunately when put to use later, it was 
cut horizontally to yield four quarters so that half of each of 
the panels is missing.
          The railing motif divides the post into panels, each of 
which is provided with a pair of pilasters with campaniform lotus 
capitals and a roll bracket. The upper panel of one of the 
preserved faces depicts Prince Vessantara confirming the gift of 
his two children to the Brahman Jujaka by pouring water from an 
ewer. The lower panel shows the four horses of a chariot, and 
three figures perhaps to be identified with the Brahman mendicants 
to whom the generous Prince donated his chariot.
         The fragmentary panel on top of the other face shows an 
elephant, to be identified with Paccaya, who was also gifted by 
the Prince even though the prosperity of a kingdom depended upon 
its possession. In the lower panel we again see the prince riding 
on a chariot driven by four horses. At the bottom of the post, 
there are crouching Yakas, supporting the panel above.","The figure has a full belly; the lower garment is decorated with 
small incised circles and is secured around the waist by the two 
ends of the cloth tied in a knot visible over the left leg. The 
bracelets consist of two rows of heavy beads, and the Yaksa holds 
the ends of a triple-stranded necklace in his two upraised hands as 
though about to wear it around his neck. The earrings are unusual 
and appear simply to be stalks passed through the earlobes. The 
head-dress consists of a fillet with three projecting plumes. The 
face is full, with narrow slanting eyes; the nose is broad, and the 
lips are thick. The entire physiognomy is reminiscent of the dwarf 
atlantes on the western gateway of Stupa I at Sanchi and on the 
southern gateway of Stupa III                                                                                                      The lower portion of the pelt is missing but the tenon which held 
the coping in place is visible. On the sides are two sockets to 
receive the cross-bars of the railing. The back is plain.","The figure stands on a railing pedestal, the right knee bent 
to 
the side while the head is turned to the left. The right 
hand is 
raised to the chest and the Left holds a full-blown lotus 
with 
projecting corolla. The lips are full, the nose flat, the 
eyelids ridged, and the brows sharply chiseled. The clothing 
and 
jewellery are similar to Museum accession no.59; but this 
image 
wears no necklace, its place being taken by a pleated scarf 
draped across the neck. The bulge of the stomach is clearly 
outlined, but is not exaggerated. Again the feet are turned 
to 
the side and shown in profile.","The top corner of the post is broken and the face of the 
Yaksa 
is damaged. He stands on a makara, the feet sloping 
downwards; 
the left hand holds an end of the scarf, and the raised hand 
probably held a lotus.  A large turban of decorated cloth 
with a 
knot to the right, heavy circular earrings, a many-stranded 
necklace looped stiffly on the chest, and beaded armlets 
comprise the ornaments. The lower garment reaches to the 
knees, 
is gathered in tight pleats between the legs, and is secured 
at 
the waist by a sash which is knotted below the rather full 
belly, the loose ends falling over the pleats. The makara 
vehicle of the Yaksa has a curled snout, two front feet, 
finlike 
ears behind the eyes, and a looped fish-tail. Below is a 
pattern 
of waving incised lines, perhaps representing water.  Museum 
accession no 59 and 58 probably form a pair. Each of them 
has 
three sockets on either side to accommodate cross-bars.","The animal is damaged, but was originally endowed with only two 
front legs. The snout is broken; the open mouth, filled with saw 
teeth, is bordered by ridged lips. The eyes are bulging and have 
thick curling eyebrows. The finlike ears are adorned with pendants, 
each consisting of four strands of beads held together by a 
rectangular plaque.
            The flat modeling of the curled tail, the top and side 
surfaces of which meet almost at right angles, are strongly 
reminiscent of Bharhut sculpture of the 2nd century B.C. The makara 
probably crowned a votive column (dhvaja stambha) before a temple 
or site sacred to Pradyumna, one of the Pancavrsnis. An image of 
the same period has also been discovered at Besnagar, ancient 
Vidisa.","The lotus plant that fills the lunate consists of a central flower 
flanked by buds and half-open blossoms, all issuing from a large 
leaf at the base. A goose is also perched on either side. The band 
above is decorated with a vine motif.",Cross-bar in the central raised medallion there is a carved figure of crocodile in relief. It has saw toothed mouth and tail bent backside.,"Small cross bar depicting a hybrid lion. It has beak and 
wings.",Pillar fragment with plain top followed by plain and butted sliced sections. Below it there are eight sections.,"Only the upper panel of the post remains. A woman is seen 
supporting herself on the branch of a tree to the left of which 
stands a much damaged female figure with hands folded in adoration. 
To the right is a stambha which appears to be surmounted by a horse 
or a lion. The panel is bordered by a row of stepped pyramids 
above, and is surrounded by a narrow band of floral buds. The 
uppermost plain section of the post bears an inscription: Pusasa 
thabhodhama.
           The panel may well be a representation of the nativity 
of the Buddha in the sala forest at Lumbini, in which case the main 
figure could be identified with Maya; this identification would be 
further reinforced if the creature represented on the stambha were 
indeed a horse as it has been conjectured that the pillar set up by 
Asoka at Lumbini was crowned by a horse capital.","""To the left is Gajalaksmi, the right hand raised in abhaya-
mudra, the clenched left hand placed on the hip. She stands on a 
large lotus from the sides of which issue stalks, the tallest 
pair supporting small elephants lustrating the Goddess with 
water poured from long-necked jars. The nudity of the Goddess is 
emphasized though she wears a diaphanous lower garment secured 
by a girdle consisting of a single strand of beads. The head-
dress consists of a fillet with projecting plumes and a central 
crest jewel. The face is slightly damaged. The earrings are 
heavy; the single necklace is composed of large beads falling 
between the breasts; also present are coiled bracelets and large 
heavy anklets. The feet point to the front, but are turned 
downwards in order to accommodate them within the frontal plane 
of the low relief. The proportions of the figure are comparable 
to those of the female bracket figures on the eastern gate of 
Stupa I at Sanchi (cf. Marshall and Foucher, The Monuments of 
Sanchi, vol. II, Pl. XLIV).
         To the right of the figure was an elephant, only the 
forehead and trunk of which now survive; and to the left is a 
bull with lyre-shaped horns. Except for the head, the animal is 
shown in profile with a foreleg raised, and is adorned by a 
large garland of twisted strands of jewels with a heavy round 
clasp.
             The die consists of two panels, one of them sloped 
diagonally at the top and filled with a knot motif formed by two 
stems with foliate ends, so disposed as to form a swastika. The 
other panel contains a triton with two fish-tails which are 
raised and clasped by the arms. The stomach bulges gently and 
the loins are covered by a leaf-like cloth that is strung to the 
girdle. The necklace seems to be made of lotus petals and the 
diadem has a pointed crest. The face is round, with puffy 
cheeks, and the wide-open eyes have ridged lids. The helix of 
the ear is shaped like a fin.
           At the outer end of the architrave, and facing 
inwards, is a two-legged makara with looped tail and a double 
row of saw-teeth with large fangs.
           The occurrence of Laksmi or Sri in the center of a 
torana architrave is interesting for she is found in a similar 
position, no doubt in her capacity as the guardian deity of the 
door, in much later temples, notably those of Orissa.                                                                                                                                                                         
The back of this fragment is plain. On top are mortice holes 
indicating that the torana had at least two architraves.""","The coping consists of a lotus rhizome, the segments filled with blue 
lotuses. The projecting band on top has a design consisting of 
alternating bells and buds suspended from an astragalus, all carved 
in very low relief. The base is missing.","The amorous scene, originally enclosed in a panel, shows a 
man embracing two women, the lady to his left being severely 
damaged. The head-dress of the woman to his right consists 
of a tall coiled bun; and her ornaments include a collar, a 
double-stranded girdle, circular anklets, and large round 
earrings. The proportions of the body, the fleshy modeling 
and the emphasized nudity of the female figures are 
reminiscent of work at Sanchi Stupa I, where the relief, 
however, is much higher. The two-footed makara, occupying 
the outer extremity of the architrave, faces inward, and has 
saw like teeth, a wrinkled snout, and a curled tail. The 
body is covered with scales and is cramped in the space 
allotted to it. The back of the slab is plain. According to 
Cunningham the fragment was dug up during the cutting of a 
road to Chitaoli (ASIR X, p. 5, Pl. III, Figures 1 & 2).",Corner rail pillar showing a standing 'yaksha' on two adjoining sides. Both of them have folded hands.,"The head and right arm are missing. The left arm is held akimbo, 
the clenched fist resting against the upper hip. The figure stands 
in samabhanga posture, the legs placed apart. Between the legs is a 
bouquet consisting of five lotus buds and one full-blown lotus 
flower. To the left of the figure, below the samghati folds are 
ashoka flowers.
           The Buddha wears a diaphanous antaravasaka reaching 
below the knees, a samghati covering the left shoulder and arm, and 
a ribbon like girdle, knotted on the right side, with the loose 
ends falling over the thigh. The folds are indicated by light 
incisions and grooved ridges. The fleshy modeling of the torso, the 
powerful legs spreading outwards below the knees, and the broad, 
square shoulders are features shared in common with other images of 
the early phase of the Kushana school of Mathura. On the back are 
traces of a halo with scalloped edge.
          This figure is a product of the great workshops at 
Mathura from where it was exported to Kaushambi, its actual find 
spot. The similarity to the Bala image, also made at Mathura, but 
found at Sarnath, is striking (cf. ASIAR, 1904-05, Pl. XXVI a-d). 
The nun Buddhamitra, who dedicated this image, is also associated 
with the Sarnath image, being mentioned in the long inscription on 
the stone post which supported the umbrella (Sahni, Catalogue of 
the Museum of Archaeology at Sarnath, p. 35).
         This figure, being dated in the second year of Kanishka, 
is the earliest dated Buddha image known. A. Ghosh, IHQ X (1934), 
p. 575 suggests that the date is perhaps to be read as anno 22 and 
not 2.","The figure is carved from a fragment of an Asokan column, its 
diameter determining the somewhat constricted shape of the arms. 
Traces of the original polished surface are to be seen on the 
sides of the arms and next to the legs.
            The squat, dwarfish figure is seated in paryankasana 
on a stool with both the legs lowered so that the feet touch the 
ground. The face is flat and broad with protruding eyes and 
ridged eyelids. The mouth, open in a grimace, reveals fanged 
teeth; and traces of a thin moustache with upturned points are 
visible above the lips. The torso is squat and corpulent, the 
chest set off from the belly by folds of flesh. The cylindrical 
cap is adorned with a circular plaque of a type associated with 
Kushana sculpture at Mathura. The dhoti is diaphanous, reaching 
to below the knees, and is deeply incised below the belly. A 
thick upavita with a knotted clasp, a collar decorated with 
square and circular plaques, and spiral earrings, can also be 
seen. Both of the hands rest at the knees; the right is cupped, 
the left holds a boar by the hind feet, the animal's body 
dangling between the Yaksa's legs.","This lunatic fragment of a railing post is filled with an 
abundance of blue lotus flowers and buds issuing from a pot. 
In the band above are a pair of geese holding flowers in their 
beaks. They are flanked by motifs of lotus flowers and buds, 
all issuing from a large leaf.","The Buddha image, obviously imitating a Mathura prototype is 
shown wearing an antaravasaka secured by a flat ribbon like 
girdle knotted over the right thigh. The diaphanous samghati 
passes over the Left shoulder, the folds being shown over the 
loins, the left shoulder and arm and also in the area between 
the arm and the body. The left hand is clenched and held just 
above the left thigh, the loose end of the samghati being draped 
over it and allowed to fall to the side. A srivatsa sign is 
lightly incised on the chest.
            The modeling of the torso is full but lacks the 
emphasized fleshiness of examples from Mathura proper. This is 
particularly noticeable in the region around the navel and the 
breasts. In this respect the image is reminiscent of the 
headless Buddha image of Sarnath (Vogel, La sculpture de 
Mathura, Pl. XXVIII-b) which is also a copy of a Mathura 
specimen, namely the famous image dedicated by the monk Bala, 
near which it was discovered. There also the contours of the 
body flow more smoothly and we have the same generalized 
modeling of the stomach. The deep navel that further accentuates 
the softness of the belly in Mathura examples is absent.",The head of Buddha with curly hair. Nose and mouth is damaged.,"Shaven head of Jina with staring eyes, of typical Kusana style from 
Mathura, defaced and damaged.","The figure shows a bust of a Bodhisattva. The figure wears a beaded collar 
and a narrow V-shaped necklace. The hair is done in curls and the halo is 
scalloped at the edges. The sculpture belongs to 'Mathura School of Art' 
style.","Stone stab showing a human bust with hands and part below 
waist lost. A halo is present behind the head of the human figure. 
This seems to be a divine image.","""Smiling female head with wide open eyes. She wears a dose-
fitting headdress familiar from the Kushana art of Mathura.""","Standing female figure holding a dagger(?) in her right hand. The 
left hand is raised above the shoulder.","Female head, rest part of the body has been lost. The hair is 
arranged upward.","Male head is made in red spotted sand stone. It has a snug nose and 
Curly hairs.","The hairs of a Jina head are carved in large snail-shell curls. 
Note particularly the bushy eye brows, the hairs of which are 
shown by incisions. The pupils of the eye are clearly indicated.","Mother cow tenderly licking when her calf is suckling milk. The 
artist has ably depicted the sentiment of maternal affection 
in the animal kingdom.","Standing four-armed Durga, carrying a long trident in the lower left hand, 
a wine-pot in the upraised lower right and a circular rayed shield in the 
upper left hand. Upper right corner of the stele is broken with the upper 
right hand which might have held a sword.",A Head of Buddha. It is highly weatherworn.,Female face with beautiful hair arrangement. Damaged at places.,Head of a male. Hair are arranged in overlapping braids. Both sides are cut off.,"Head of deity, probably Bodhisattva, wearing typical fan- shaped Kusana crown and heavy kundalas.","Male (?) head hair supported by a hand. A crest is shown on 
left side of the forehead.","A male head is carved in 'Mathura Art' form. The hairs are fastened with a 
fillet and arranged in horizontal rows of curls falling over the ears. 
These are rendered by short semicircular incisions. The coiffure is 
unusual and indicates that the head may have belonged to the image of a 
secular personage.",Head of a female with hair arranged back side and an ornamental crest on forehead. There is an spear shaped object present at top of her left side.,Male head with hair arranged backside.,Male head with hair arranged backside.,Mutilated bust of female deity with prominent breasts. She is shown under an arched canopy. The goddess has close-set breasts and wears heavy ear-ornaments and a torque.  The museum has a better preserved specimen of a similar figure from Mathura.,"Rectagular stone slab with four life scenes of Buddha on its all 
four side faces. There are Buddhas birth in Lumbini. Victory 
over Mara (cupid)at Gaya. Ist sermon at Sarnath and 
mahaparinirvana at Kushinagara. First and third scene is flanked 
by seated crusslgged Buddha figures on both sides. Several 
status are damaged in all four s","A Digambara Ksapanka having pasubandha intercourse with a female. 
The ksapanaka holds a rajoharana in his armpit.","Heavily built torso of a Yaksa(?) carrying mutilate musala in left 
hand, right hand broken. The god is draped in a dhoti and a scarf 
which passes over the left shoulder and going cross-wise at the 
back flutters down the left arm after loosely winding round the 
waist. Ekavali is the only ornament worn by the god. The broad 
scarf worn crosswise at the back is an unusual feature. Is he 
Mudgarapani Yaksa?",Damaged bust of a bearded person holding a stick in his right hand.,"Slab depicting goddess Mahismardini killing the buffalo demon, Mahisasura.",Fragment showing  seated figure of Kuber with a purse in his right hand. There was an other figure seated to his left evidently.,Stone stele with a seated figure of goddess who holds a trident in her right hand.,"A female is holding a chauri in the upraised right hand and flaps 
over the shoulder. The earrings consist of long strands of pearls.",Head of a male with an elongated head dress.,Lion head.
