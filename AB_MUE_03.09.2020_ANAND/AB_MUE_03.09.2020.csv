Brief Description,Fragment of a railing post depicting the Sasa Jataka.
Detailed Description,"In the foreground is a tank with two fishes, and above it is a 
blazing hearth towards which jumps a small animal, most probably 
a hare. To the proper right are two baskets of mangoes; to the 
left, behind the hare, are an otter and a lizard. Above these 
can be discerned the legs of another animal, a spouted jar, and 
the knees of a cross-legged seated figure.
            The scene undoubtedly illustrates the Sasa Jataka 
which relates how once when King Brahmadatta was reigning in 
Banaras the Bodhisattva lived in the forest as a young hare. The 
hare had three friends, a jackal, an otter, and a monkey. The 
hare advised his friends to give alms, to observe the sacred 
law, and honour the holy days. One day all the four went to the 
woods. The otter collected fish; the monkey gathered mangoes; 
and the jackal took a lizard and a pot of curds from the house 
of a watchman, but the hare could not collect anything. Sakka 
appeared in disguise, begging food from the hare, who offered 
him his body, having nothing else to give. The hare jumped into 
the fire, but miraculously would not burn.
             The Jataka is also represented at Nagarjunikonda 
(MASI No.54, Pl. XVIII) and Amaravati (Fergusson, Tree and & 
srepent Worship, Pl. LXXXII, Fig. 2)."

indicate 
the presence of a crest jewel The earrings are square blocks

other 
ornaments are a many-stranded collar, worn over a longer 
necklace, now barely visible, and an upvita strung with

Detailed Description,"It is a fragment of the inner face of a coping stone of the Bharhut 
railing. Between the usual upper and lower borders of stepped 
pyramids and pendant bells of the coping stone are reliefs which 
fill the four compartments formed by the undulating creepers 
(kalpavalli). Beginning from the left, we first see a calyx 
yielding a cloth, probably a lower garment; and two men engaged in 
conversation within a courtyard formed by three buildings, the 
structure to the right having three finials. The figure on the left 
has the right hand raised in the attitude of exposition while the 
left hand holds an animal. He is conversing with the figure on the 
right, who listens attentively. Another animal can be seen perched 
on the roof of the house in the foreground. This roof is gabled, 
consisting of sloping rafters thatched with grass; the other two 
roofs are vaulted and supported lengthwise by wooden beams, the 
ends of which are visible. A circular earring decorated with 
grooved concentric circles is used as space filler just above the 
building on the right. The adjoining panel shows the creeper 
emitting a four-stranded necklace, circular bangles, and a dancer's 
anklet (?) fringed with bells. The panel on the far right contains 
a hut, octagonal in plan, and provided with a domical roof having a 
finial made of lashed sticks.
 Above the two standing figures in conversation is inscribed 
gajajataka saso, and above the domed hut can be discerned the word 
jatake; translated by Luders as ""the Jataka of the elephant. The 
hare.., in the Jataka (?)""."

Brief Description,Fragment of a railing post depicting scenes from the Vessantara Jataka.
Detailed Description,"This was undoubtedly one of the terminal or corner posts of the 
railing and its returns at the four gateways, as it is decorated 
on two adjacent faces. Unfortunately when put to use later, it was 
cut horizontally to yield four quarters so that half of each of 
the panels is missing.
          The railing motif divides the post into panels, each of 
which is provided with a pair of pilasters with campaniform lotus 
capitals and a roll bracket. The upper panel of one of the 
preserved faces depicts Prince Vessantara confirming the gift of 
his two children to the Brahman Jujaka by pouring water from an 
ewer. The lower panel shows the four horses of a chariot, and 
three figures perhaps to be identified with the Brahman mendicants 
to whom the generous Prince donated his chariot.
         The fragmentary panel on top of the other face shows an 
elephant, to be identified with Paccaya, who was also gifted by 
the Prince even though the prosperity of a kingdom depended upon 
its possession. In the lower panel we again see the prince riding 
on a chariot driven by four horses. At the bottom of the post, 
there are crouching Yakas, supporting the panel above."

Brief Description,"Railing Pillar showing standing figure of a yaksha holding a garland 
of beads. His hairs are supported by a fillet to which three leaves 
are stuck."
Detailed Description,"The figure has a full belly; the lower garment is decorated with 
small incised circles and is secured around the waist by the two 
ends of the cloth tied in a knot visible over the left leg. The 
bracelets consist of two rows of heavy beads, and the Yaksa holds 
the ends of a triple-stranded necklace in his two upraised hands as 
though about to wear it around his neck. The earrings are unusual 
and appear simply to be stalks passed through the earlobes. The 
head-dress consists of a fillet with three projecting plumes. The 
face is full, with narrow slanting eyes; the nose is broad, and the 
lips are thick. The entire physiognomy is reminiscent of the dwarf 
atlantes on the western gateway of Stupa I at Sanchi and on the 
southern gateway of Stupa III                                                                                                      The lower portion of the pelt is missing but the tenon which held 
the coping in place is visible. On the sides are two sockets to 
receive the cross-bars of the railing. The back is plain."

wears no necklace, its place being taken by a pleated scarf 
draped across the neck. The bulge of the stomach is clearly 
outlined, but is not exaggerated. Again the feet are turned 
to 
the side and shown in profile."

Detailed Description,"The top corner of the post is broken and the face of the 
Yaksa 
is damaged. He stands on a makara, the feet sloping 
downwards; 
the left hand holds an end of the scarf, and the raised hand 
probably held a lotus.  A large turban of decorated cloth 
with a 
knot to the right, heavy circular earrings, a many-stranded 
necklace looped stiffly on the chest, and beaded armlets 
comprise the ornaments. The lower garment reaches to the 
knees, 
is gathered in tight pleats between the legs, and is secured 
at 
the waist by a sash which is knotted below the rather full 
belly, the loose ends falling over the pleats. The makara 
vehicle of the Yaksa has a curled snout, two front feet, 
finlike 
ears behind the eyes, and a looped fish-tail. Below is a 
pattern 
of waving incised lines, perhaps representing water.  Museum 
accession no 59 and 58 probably form a pair. Each of them 
has 
three sockets on either side to accommodate cross-bars."

Brief Description,Fragmented piece of a Makara Capital.
Detailed Description,"The animal is damaged, but was originally endowed with only two 
front legs. The snout is broken; the open mouth, filled with saw 
teeth, is bordered by ridged lips. The eyes are bulging and have 
thick curling eyebrows. The finlike ears are adorned with pendants, 
each consisting of four strands of beads held together by a 
rectangular plaque.
            The flat modeling of the curled tail, the top and side 
surfaces of which meet almost at right angles, are strongly 
reminiscent of Bharhut sculpture of the 2nd century B.C. The makara 
probably crowned a votive column (dhvaja stambha) before a temple 
or site sacred to Pradyumna, one of the Pancavrsnis. An image of 
the same period has also been discovered at Besnagar, ancient 
Vidisa."

supporting herself on the branch of a tree to the left of which 
stands a much damaged female figure with hands folded in adoration.

above, and is surrounded by a narrow band of floral buds. The 
uppermost plain section of the post bears an inscription: Pusasa 
thabhodhama.
           The panel may well be a representation of the nativity 
of the Buddha in the sala forest at Lumbini, in which case the main 
figure could be identified with Maya; this identification would be 
further reinforced if the creature represented on the stambha were 
indeed a horse as it has been conjectured that the pillar set up by 
Asoka at Lumbini was crowned by a horse capital."

Brief Description,"Fragment of an architrave. Beginning from the kleft it shows 
Gajalaksmi followed by a bull, a leafy stylized Swastika and a 
crocodile with yawning mouth. In between the leafy motif and 
crocodile, there present a triton with two fish tails clasped in 
his arms."
Detailed Description,"""To the left is Gajalaksmi, the right hand raised in abhaya-
mudra, the clenched left hand placed on the hip. She stands on a 
large lotus from the sides of which issue stalks, the tallest 
pair supporting small elephants lustrating the Goddess with 
water poured from long-necked jars. The nudity of the Goddess is 
emphasized though she wears a diaphanous lower garment secured 
by a girdle consisting of a single strand of beads. The head-
dress consists of a fillet with projecting plumes and a central 
crest jewel. The face is slightly damaged. The earrings are 
heavy; the single necklace is composed of large beads falling 
between the breasts; also present are coiled bracelets and large 
heavy anklets. The feet point to the front, but are turned 
downwards in order to accommodate them within the frontal plane 
of the low relief. The proportions of the figure are comparable 
to those of the female bracket figures on the eastern gate of 
Stupa I at Sanchi (cf. Marshall and Foucher, The Monuments of 
Sanchi, vol. II, Pl. XLIV).
         To the right of the figure was an elephant, only the 
forehead and trunk of which now survive; and to the left is a 
bull with lyre-shaped horns. Except for the head, the animal is 
shown in profile with a foreleg raised, and is adorned by a 
large garland of twisted strands of jewels with a heavy round 
clasp.
             The die consists of two panels, one of them sloped 
diagonally at the top and filled with a knot motif formed by two 
stems with foliate ends, so disposed as to form a swastika. The 
other panel contains a triton with two fish-tails which are 
raised and clasped by the arms. The stomach bulges gently and 
the loins are covered by a leaf-like cloth that is strung to the 
girdle. The necklace seems to be made of lotus petals and the 
diadem has a pointed crest. The face is round, with puffy 
cheeks, and the wide-open eyes have ridged lids. The helix of 
the ear is shaped like a fin.
           At the outer end of the architrave, and facing 
inwards, is a two-legged makara with looped tail and a double 
row of saw-teeth with large fangs.
           The occurrence of Laksmi or Sri in the center of a 
torana architrave is interesting for she is found in a similar 
position, no doubt in her capacity as the guardian deity of the 
door, in much later temples, notably those of Orissa.                                                                                                                                                                         
The back of this fragment is plain. On top are mortice holes 
indicating that the torana had at least two architraves."""

Brief Description,"An architectural fragment carved with a crocodile with an up 
turned tail to the left side and two human figurines (one is 
female image) to the right side of the stone piece. Another 
figure is highly damaged."
Detailed Description,"The amorous scene, originally enclosed in a panel, shows a 
man embracing two women, the lady to his left being severely 
damaged. The head-dress of the woman to his right consists 
of a tall coiled bun; and her ornaments include a collar, a 
double-stranded girdle, circular anklets, and large round 
earrings. The proportions of the body, the fleshy modeling 
and the emphasized nudity of the female figures are 
reminiscent of work at Sanchi Stupa I, where the relief, 
however, is much higher. The two-footed makara, occupying 
the outer extremity of the architrave, faces inward, and has 
saw like teeth, a wrinkled snout, and a curled tail. The 
body is covered with scales and is cramped in the space 
allotted to it. The back of the slab is plain. According to 
Cunningham the fragment was dug up during the cutting of a 
road to Chitaoli (ASIR X, p. 5, Pl. III, Figures 1 & 2)."

8th day of the 2nd (month) of Hemanta, (Buddhist) nun Buddhamitra, 
who is well-versed in the Tripitaka, sets up (this image of) 
Bodhisattva at the promenade of the Lord Buddha."

Brief Description,An image of standing Bodhisattva dedicated by a lady monk Buddhamitra.
Detailed Description,"The head and right arm are missing. The left arm is held akimbo, 
the clenched fist resting against the upper hip. The figure stands 
in samabhanga posture, the legs placed apart. Between the legs is a 
bouquet consisting of five lotus buds and one full-blown lotus 
flower. To the left of the figure, below the samghati folds are 
ashoka flowers.
           The Buddha wears a diaphanous antaravasaka reaching 
below the knees, a samghati covering the left shoulder and arm, and 
a ribbon like girdle, knotted on the right side, with the loose 
ends falling over the thigh. The folds are indicated by light 
incisions and grooved ridges. The fleshy modeling of the torso, the 
powerful legs spreading outwards below the knees, and the broad, 
square shoulders are features shared in common with other images of 
the early phase of the Kushana school of Mathura. On the back are 
traces of a halo with scalloped edge.
          This figure is a product of the great workshops at 
Mathura from where it was exported to Kaushambi, its actual find 
spot. The similarity to the Bala image, also made at Mathura, but 
found at Sarnath, is striking (cf. ASIAR, 1904-05, Pl. XXVI a-d). 
The nun Buddhamitra, who dedicated this image, is also associated 
with the Sarnath image, being mentioned in the long inscription on 
the stone post which supported the umbrella (Sahni, Catalogue of 
the Museum of Archaeology at Sarnath, p. 35).
         This figure, being dated in the second year of Kanishka, 
is the earliest dated Buddha image known. A. Ghosh, IHQ X (1934), 
p. 575 suggests that the date is perhaps to be read as anno 22 and 
not 2."

holds a bowl in his right hand while the left firmly holds the leg 
of a pig. He wears a dhoti and various ornaments. He has 
moustaches large eyes and a wide open mouth. A flat hand lies 
across his chest."
Detailed Description,"The figure is carved from a fragment of an Asokan column, its 
diameter determining the somewhat constricted shape of the arms. 
Traces of the original polished surface are to be seen on the 
sides of the arms and next to the legs.
            The squat, dwarfish figure is seated in paryankasana 
on a stool with both the legs lowered so that the feet touch the 
ground. The face is flat and broad with protruding eyes and 
ridged eyelids. The mouth, open in a grimace, reveals fanged 
teeth; and traces of a thin moustache with upturned points are 
visible above the lips. The torso is squat and corpulent, the 
chest set off from the belly by folds of flesh. The cylindrical 
cap is adorned with a circular plaque of a type associated with 
Kushana sculpture at Mathura. The dhoti is diaphanous, reaching 
to below the knees, and is deeply incised below the belly. A 
thick upavita with a knotted clasp, a collar decorated with 
square and circular plaques, and spiral earrings, can also be 
seen. Both of the hands rest at the knees; the right is cupped, 
the left holds a boar by the hind feet, the animal's body 
dangling between the Yaksa's legs."

Detailed Description,"The Buddha image, obviously imitating a Mathura prototype is 
shown wearing an antaravasaka secured by a flat ribbon like 
girdle knotted over the right thigh. The diaphanous samghati 
passes over the Left shoulder, the folds being shown over the 
loins, the left shoulder and arm and also in the area between 
the arm and the body. The left hand is clenched and held just 
above the left thigh, the loose end of the samghati being draped 
over it and allowed to fall to the side. A srivatsa sign is 
lightly incised on the chest.
            The modeling of the torso is full but lacks the 
emphasized fleshiness of examples from Mathura proper. This is 
particularly noticeable in the region around the navel and the 
breasts. In this respect the image is reminiscent of the 
headless Buddha image of Sarnath (Vogel, La sculpture de 
Mathura, Pl. XXVIII-b) which is also a copy of a Mathura 
specimen, namely the famous image dedicated by the monk Bala, 
near which it was discovered. There also the contours of the 
body flow more smoothly and we have the same generalized 
modeling of the stomach. The deep navel that further accentuates 
the softness of the belly in Mathura examples is absent."
